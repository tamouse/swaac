The Electronic Freedom Foundation ([EFF]) is working
to [encrypt the web](https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web), converting
all web sites from HTTP to
HTTPS. [Baratunde Thurston](http://baratunde.com/) narrates the video
explaining web encryption to the masses.

You may notice my sites don't use HTTPS. The only reason is I've not
gotten around to implementing it yet.

I've used it on projects, and it's pretty simple to set up. Look for a
future post, probably.
