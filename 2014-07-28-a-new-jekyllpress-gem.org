So, I made a new thing. :D

[[https://github.com/tamouse/jekyllpress][jekyllpress]]

It's a [[https://github.com/erikhuda/thor][thor]] script that does a few
things right now (so alpha!):

- set up a =_templates= directory in your =source= directory.
- create new posts and pages.

More to come!

Of particular note, this works with the *latest* version of
[[http://jekyllrb.com][=jekyll=]], unlike the current version of that
other press thing...
