The great [codeship.com](http://www.codeship.com)'s
[Florian Motlik](http://blog.codeship.com/author/florianmotlik/)
writes a superb tutorial on building virtual machines with
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and
[Packer](http://www.packer.io). Being able to swiftly build virtual
machines is something I find essential for development, test, staging,
and deployment.
