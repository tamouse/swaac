[Gerald Weinberg](http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/) is a long-time
writer and commenter on the field of software enginering. I've been a
longtime fan of Jerry, and had the privilege and pleasure of meeting
him, working with him on some stuff back at HP, and attending one of
his seminars.

He's always proven faithful to my vision of how the field of software
development should be run, in a humane, thoughtful, and intelligent
fashion.

[Here's his answer]({{post.source}}) to the question: "What was your most challenging
experience in software development?"

The moral at the end is really the most important take-away for all of
us learning and working in this area:

> Moral: We may think that hardware and software errors are
> challenging, but nothing matches the difficulty of confronting human
> errorsâ€”especially when those humans are managers willing to hide
> errors in order to make schedules.

Software development is ultimately a human system, focused on solving
human problems. This also brings into it all the human fallabilities
and problems. Keep clear what's important.
