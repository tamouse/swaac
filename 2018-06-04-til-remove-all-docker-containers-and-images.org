* Remove all docker containers and images

- Created On: 2018-06-04

I needed to do a reset on my work machine of the Docker stuff I was
using, so needed to know how to do this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
    $ docker rmi $(docker images -q)
#+END_SRC

~docker ps -aq~ gives a list of all the container hashes, which is given the ~docker rm~ command.

Similarly, ~docker images -q~ lists all the docker image hashes, which is given to docker's "remove images" ~rmi~ command.
