Playing with Grid and Flexbox
=============================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So last month, March 2017, Grid CSS support dropped for almost all the major browsers. Grid is a pretty nice system for 2-dimensional layout while Flexbox remains a good system for 1-dimensional layout. A lot of folks have been asking [if Grid replaces Flexbox but it does not](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-replace-flexbox/). In fact, they can play really well together.

GridCSS Holy Grail Layout
-------------------------

The \[holy grail\] layout is a pretty common one, seen pretty much everywhere:

-   header and footer
-   middle content area with left and right sidebars

Creating it in Grid was something I wanted to try to figure out as a way of learning. My attempt is over on CodePen.io:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="zwwwwZ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="tamouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="GridCSS holy grail" class="codepen">

See the Pen GridCSS holy grail by Tamara Temple (@tamouse) on CodePen.

</p>

I\'m still struggling with getting the height to stretch out if the content does not naturally fill the window.

Flexbox Dashboard with Grid Section
-----------------------------------

This was more successful. I wanted a full-height left navigation panel and a masonry-style right panel that would let various guages and displays flow nicely.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="EmmXdr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="tamouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Flexbox Dashboard with Grid Section" class="codepen">

See the Pen Flexbox Dashboard with Grid Section by Tamara Temple (@tamouse) on CodePen.

</p>

It\'s not really responsive, I\'d like it if the left panel shrunk down when the viewport gets narrow enough, but I don\'t think I can make that happen on codepen.
