There\'s an excellent article over at [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) by Eric Bailey, [ARIA is Spackle, Not Rebar](https://css-tricks.com/aria-spackle-not-rebar/), written November 2017, that lays out the reasons when to use ARIA ([Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/)) directly, and most importantly in my view, when [not]{.underline} to use it explicitly (tl;dr: most of the time).

I think this sums up the intent nicely:

> Before considering other options, start with markup that semantically describes the content it is wrapping.

And while that is definitely true, it really does help to understand what ARIA is for and how it works. So while we\'re on the subject, I want to point out the excellent [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) course: [Website Accessibility](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-accessibility/) by Jon Kuperman.
