Just a few links. I don\'t know if this is a good collection anymore. I also don\'t know why these aren\'t just regular posts.

CSS
---

-   [Autoprefixer](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is a CSS post-processor that automatically adds CSS vendor prefixes and fixes the CSS to work in many browser versions that don\'t yet have full support for CSS features. See also \"Can I Use\" below.

-   [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/) shows which browsers support which features.

-   [Flexbox in 5 minutes](http://flexboxin5.com/) is a nice application that introduces the CSS flexbox feature. See also: [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

-   [CSS-Tricks Blog](https://css-tricks.com/) is a great site for learning about nify CSS stuff.

Databases
---------

-   [Constructing a less than simple query with rails and arel](http://blog.donwilson.net/2011/11/constructing-a-less-than-simple-query-with-rails-and-arel/) This is from back in 2011, so is probably out of date, but still contains some fascinating use of AREL instead of writing straight SQL.

-   [The definitive guide to Arel, the SQL manager for Ruby](http://jpospisil.com/2014/06/16/the-definitive-guide-to-arel-the-sql-manager-for-ruby.html) This is more recent, still talking about using [AREL](https://github.com/rails/arel) but in much more depth.
