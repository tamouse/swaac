Recently I took a couple classes from
[[http://www.frontendmasters.com][FrontendMasters]] lead by
[[http://getify.me/][Kyle Simpson]] on JavaScript Basics to Building,
and JavaScript Types, Coercion, and Sharing.

These are images of the notes I took:

{% for image in page.gallery.images %}
[[file:%7B%7B%20image%20%7C%20prepend:%20page.gallery.path%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.s3path%20%7D%7D]]

{% endfor %}
