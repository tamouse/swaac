  We occasionally have students ask for help on software, "My software
  is perfect, but it doesn't work!" Your software is never perfect. My
  own software is never perfect. I recently found that I made someone's
  top ten list with regard to software that I had written 37 years ago.
  It's not a top ten list anyone would aspire to be listed on. Software
  that I wrote in 1979 is number two on this list of ten historical
  software bugs with extreme consequences. I learned some very important
  lessons from that experience.

downfall.
