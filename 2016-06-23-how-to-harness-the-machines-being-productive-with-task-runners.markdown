An overview of the four most common JavaScript-based task runners in use today:

* Grunt
* Gulp
* Webpack
* npm scripts

Why limit it to JS-based? Because they will run on all the OSes as
well, not just the classic *nix-based distros.

Personally, I'm loving [Webpack] with npm scripts these days. :)
