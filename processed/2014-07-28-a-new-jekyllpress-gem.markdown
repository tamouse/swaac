So, I made a new thing. :D

[jekyllpress](https://github.com/tamouse/jekyllpress)

It's a [thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) script that does a few things right now (so alpha!):

* set up a `_templates` directory in your `source` directory.
* create new posts and pages.

More to come!

Of particular note, this works with the **latest** version of [`jekyll`](http://jekyllrb.com), unlike the current version of that other press thing...
