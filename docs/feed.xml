[[https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html#supported-types-for-arguments][Rails Guides: ActiveJob Supported Argument Types]]

This came up because of a cascade of things:

1. Having an exception thrown during an ActiveJob task
2. The rescue calling ActiveMailer with the rescued exception as an argument, with the ~.deliver_later~ option
3. This caused another ActiveJob to be created for the mailer, with an argument that violates the above restriction.

The solution, in this case is pretty easy: call the mailer with ~.deliver_now~ instead, since it&#39;s already a background job.

** What&#39;s a Programmer&#39;s Primary Language?

*Profanity*

So that&#39;s a really old joke, and I&#39;d thought I&#39;d written something about it long ago.

There&#39;s a funny comic that goes around from time to time (I&#39;d thought it was one of Randall Monroe&#39;s, but it&#39;s not): https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/

[[wtfsm.jpg]]

It&#39;s often sourced from [[http://commadot.com/wtf-per-minute/][this blog entry]] with a computer-drawn version, but I rather like the original.

** TIL: Firefox disables the meta refresh header by default

This came up with a story I was implementing, where we wanted an interstitial page to show up after a new client signs up for our product, basically a &quot;Thank You&quot; page, which is needed for tracking stuff in google analytics.

I thought to use the ~meta http-equiv=refresh~ header, which I&#39;ve used for a very long time. Come to learn, however, the the Firefox browser disables this header by default.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29645340/why-does-meta-refresh-not-work-in-firefox

Because we don&#39;t want to force users to update their browser configurations before signing up for an account, I used the JavaScript redirect method instead.

I really hope browser writers don&#39;t decide that method is too risky for browser users; it would mean a lot of client apps might no longer work all of a sudden.

This is why we can&#39;t have nice things :(

Hat-tip to @Andrea on WHCTC slack

** Flexbox Patterns

   Link: [[https://www.flexboxpatterns.com/][Flexbox Patterns]]

   Tagline: Build awesome user interfaces with CSS flexbox. Examples and source code included.

   Description: Flexbox is awesome, but it introduces many new concepts that can make it difficult to use. These interactive examples will show you practical ways to use it to build UI components. They start out simple and get more complex near the end. You can start using these patterns in your own code right away, though I recommend you apply accessibility best practices to the markup (like using semantic HTML5 elements).

** Solved by Flexbox

   Link: [[https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/][Solved by Flexbox]]

   Tagline: Cleaner, hack-free CSS

   Description: CSS has been lacking proper layout mechanisms for far too long. Transitions, animations, filters, all of these are great and useful additions to the language, but they don&#39;t address the major problems that Web developers have been complaining about for what seems like an eternity.

   Finally, thanks to Flexbox, we have a solution.

   This site is not another CSS framework. Instead, its purpose is to showcase problems once hard or impossible to solve with CSS alone, now made trivially easy with Flexbox. And with the recent release of Internet Explorer 11 and Safari 6.1, the latest Flexbox spec is now supported in every modern browser.

   Check out the demos below. View the styles in the Web inspector or dive into the source to see just how easy CSS layout will become once Flexbox becomes mainstream.


** How to examine Flexbox layouts in Firefox

   Link: [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_Flexbox_layouts][CSS Flexbox Inspector: Examine Flexbox layouts]]

   Description: The Flexbox Inspector allows you to examine CSS Flexbox Layouts using the Firefox DevTools, discovering flex containers on a page, examining and modifying them, debugging layout issues, and more.

** Remember:


#+CAPTION: prefer pluck to map
[[../../../images/prefer-pluck-to-map.jpg]]


   When extracting specific columns from an ActiveRecord::Collection, prefer ~pluck(:field1, :field2, :field3)~ to ~map{|row| [row[:field], row[:field], row[:field]]}~. This more often comes up when you want just the ~:id~, for example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     @work_task_type = @account
			 .task_types
			 .where(name: &quot;Work&quot;)
			 .pluck(:id)

     # vs

     @work_task_type = @account
			 .task_types
			 .where(name: &quot;Work&quot;)
			 .map(&amp;:id)

   #+END_SRC

In the past, when I&#39;ve wanted to create a verse, perhaps in a blockquote I&#39;ve resorted to using ~&lt;br&gt;~ on every line, which is tedious:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  &gt; Listen, little children, all,&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; Listen to our earnest call:&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; You are very young, &#39;tis true,&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; But there&#39;s much that you can do.&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; Even you can plead with men&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; That they buy not slaves again,&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; And that those they have may be&lt;br&gt;
  &gt; Quickly set at liberty.&lt;br&gt;

#+END_SRC

In ~kramdown~, the default markdown processor in [[Jekyll]] these days, there&#39;s an easier way:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  &gt; Listen, little children, all,
  &gt; Listen to our earnest call:
  &gt; You are very young, &#39;tis true,
  &gt; But there&#39;s much that you can do.

* How to reset iOS simulator

I ran into an issue recently where I was trying to debug a problem in a project, but had a problem accessing the right data server since I was logged into a local development server, and really needed to get back to the &quot;new app&quot; state.

I searched for &quot;reset xcode simulator&quot; via DDG and first hit came up with &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16195859/reset-ios-simulator-application-data-to-run-app-for-first-time#16195931&gt; which gave me an answer.

The command line versions work, but it can be a pain to get the UDID for the simulator. Doing it from the running simulator was easier, but of course the menu options are different than discussed in the stackoverflow answer.

I found it on the Simulator (Version 10.0 (SimulatorApp-835.2.1) seen in the following screen shot:

* TIL: jQuery .attr() vs .prop()
   - last update: Time-stamp: &lt;2019-05-02 08:14:03 tamara&gt;

** Intro

   Sometime in the past, jQuery only had an ~.attr()~ method for looking at and setting an element&#39;s attributes. More recently, it acquired the ~.prop()~ method for setting a node&#39;s properties.

** Radio Button example

   The problem I ran into this with was old code that dealt with toggling radio buttons on a form:

    #+BEGIN_SRC rjsx
      $(&#39;#customer_which_billing_address_service&#39;).attr(&#39;checked&#39;, true);
    #+END_SRC

    This would set the sense of the attribute in the source, but it wouldn&#39;t change the property, so the radio button remained unchecked visually; in addition, when the form was submitted the radio buttons set didn&#39;t get posted correctly.

    Changing this to the ~.prop()~ method fixed both problems:

    #+BEGIN_SRC rjsx
      $(&#39;#customer_which_billing_address_parent&#39;).prop(&#39;checked&#39;, false);
      $(&#39;#customer_which_billing_address_service&#39;).prop(&#39;checked&#39;, true);
    #+END_SRC

    This visually set the proper radio button, and when the form was submitted the correct radio button value was posted.

#+LATEX_HEADER:

* FlashToastr React Component using React Hooks

  Today I set out on a learning journey. I&#39;d been looking at React&#39;s Hooks implementation for a bit, but haven&#39;t really gone out to make anything.

  The app I work on, Kickserv, has a Redux-based Flash message component that used in the new React-based client. It&#39;s rather large, and totally over-engineered for the need it&#39;s fulfilling.

  Roll up with Hooks in React 16.8 getting full support, and I figured it&#39;s really time to buckle down and learn them.

** First mis-direction

   Initially, I thought I would be able to do this using only ~useState~ in the hook. This led to a few hours of hair-pulling, the wailing of gnashing of teeth, and a few good swears. It turns out I was missing something really important:

   &gt; When you use ~useState~, *it&#39;s actually creating new state*

   This is probably obvious, and it shouldn&#39;t need stating, but it was breaking me. See, for the flash message thing, it&#39;s treated sort of like a modal, but not really. It needs a context to be able to let a component anywhere within the app be able to submit a flash message to it, and have the little toastr overlay alert show up. In this app, there is only one, they don&#39;t stack up like notifications do in other systems, they just show up at the top of the page until dismissed by the user, a la Rails&#39; flash messages.

** Enter Context

   What I figured out finally was that I needed a context that would keep state across the app and for the flash components themselves. This turned out to be pretty nifty and solved things quite nicely.

   The context holds information on what the flash message is, what level of message it is, and whether the message is showing or not. In addition, it has setters for each of these. The context provider .. erm .. provides them, and the hook picks them up with ~useContext~, implements 2 convenience functions for setting/showing the flash, and another for closing it.

** Storybook View

   The component is illustrated using storybook, and can be seen at [[https://flash_toastr.surge.sh/]] .

** Github Repo

   The repo containing the code is out at [[https://github.com/tamouse/flash_toaster]] if you want to play around with it or something.

There&#39;s an excellent article over at [[https://css-tricks.com/][CSS Tricks]] by Eric Bailey, [[https://css-tricks.com/aria-spackle-not-rebar/][ARIA is Spackle, Not Rebar]], written November 2017, that lays out the reasons when to use ARIA ([[https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/][Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite]]) directly, and most importantly in my view, when _not_ to use it explicitly (tl;dr: most of the time).

I think this sums up the intent nicely:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Before considering other options, start with markup that semantically describes the content it is wrapping.
#+END_QUOTE

And while that is definitely true, it really does help to understand what ARIA is for and how it works. So while we&#39;re on the subject, I want to point out the excellent [[https://frontendmasters.com][Frontend Masters]] course: [[https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-accessibility/][Website Accessibility]] by Jon Kuperman.
