Just posted on G+ today, a cool new site providing tips for working
with our beloved [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com):
[Jekyll Tips](http://jekyll.tips/)

Really great set of ideas, in a nice progressive form of discovery and
learning. I'm pleased that I've come up with similar ideas and
different ideas on how to implement things in Jekyll.

Some day, I'll get my stuff written and put together. Meanwhile,
there's my [colophon]({{ "/colophon/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
