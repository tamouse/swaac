TL;DR: [Beginner Learning Pages][beginner_link]


I am far, far removed from being a beginner at software crafts. I
wrote my first BASIC program, a lunar lander game, in 1969, on a
cranky old teletype. The program was saved on punched paper tape.

The current age of computers, software development practice, and,
probably most importantly, the availability, ubiquity, and
democratisation of computers and software development learning
materials is so vastly different from 1969. No surprise, I'm not
saying anything new. But the implications for me are that it is really
hard to re-acquire the mind-set of someone so brand new to programming
that they really don't have any sense of how things work with
absolutely no reference frames to hang things off of when they set
down to learn.

This is frustrating for both of us. I've forgotten what I didn't used
to know. You don't know what you need to learn.

{% assign beginner_link = site.baseurl | append: "/pages/learning/beginner/" %}

So I'm starting a new section in the pages of this blog, under
[beginner_link]
useful. In this section, I want to put together some information for
beginners.

They're not going to come in any particular order, for I'm still
learning what might be needed. Organization will come, hopefully not
too late, and not too poorly.

This section is also going to be very, very Unix, Linux, GNU, and Mac
OSX focused, since that's all I really have familiarity with.

Here's a couple I've started off with. I'd really love to hear some
feedback on them.

* [How do I get to the command line on a Mac?]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/learning/beginner/how-do-i-get-to-the-command-line-on-a-mac)
* [Setting up your Mac for working on the command line]({{ site.baseurl}}/pages/learning/beginner/setting-up-your-mac-for-working-on-the-command-line)
