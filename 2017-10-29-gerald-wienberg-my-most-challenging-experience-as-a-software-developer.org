[[http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/][Gerald Weinberg]] is a long-time
writer and commenter on the field of software enginering. I've been a
longtime fan of Jerry, and had the privilege and pleasure of meeting
him, working with him on some stuff back at HP, and attending one of his
seminars.

He's always proven faithful to my vision of how the field of software
development should be run, in a humane, thoughtful, and intelligent
fashion.

"What was your most challenging experience in software development?"

The moral at the end is really the most important take-away for all of
us learning and working in this area:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Moral: We may think that hardware and software errors are challenging,
  but nothing matches the difficulty of confronting human
  errors---especially when those humans are managers willing to hide
  errors in order to make schedules.
#+END_QUOTE

Software development is ultimately a human system, focused on solving
human problems. This also brings into it all the human fallabilities and
problems. Keep clear what's important.
