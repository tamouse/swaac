* Link: Must have gems for development machine in ruby on rails | CodeBeerStartups

Someone's idea of a set of /must-have/ gems for rails development. This article is so out of date, it's practically useless.

** Summary

It's not a bad list, for 2013.

As of today, Sun Sep  2 23:50:31 2018, the following make it into any Rails apps I'm starting up:

- ~pry-rails~ - makes Pry the default rails console
- ~pry-byebug~ - works with ~byebug~ to integrate with Pry
- ~faker~ - for generating test data
- ~factory_bot_rails~ - to build models for testing

You can bet strongly in 5 more years, that list will be obsolete, too.
