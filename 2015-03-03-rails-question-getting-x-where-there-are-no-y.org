There was a question recently in the =#RubyOnRails= IRC channel on
[[http://www.freenode.net][freenode]]: "How can I retrieve all the
questions that don't have answers?".
[[file:%7B%7B%20page.source%20%7D%7D][This Rails coding example shows
the answer]].

** Two Models
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: two-models
   :END:

- Question
- Answer

** Associations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: associations
   :END:

- Question /has\_many/ Answers
- Answer /belongs\_to/ Question

** Finding Questions with No Answers:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: finding-questions-with-no-answers
   :END:

{% highlight ruby %} Question.includes(:answers).where(answers: {id:
nil}) {% endhighlight %}

** Converse: Finding All Questions that have Answers:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: converse-finding-all-questions-that-have-answers

{% highlight ruby %} Question.includes(:answers).where.not(answers: {id:
nil}) {% endhighlight %}
