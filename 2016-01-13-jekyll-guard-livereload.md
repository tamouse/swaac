**UPDATE:** This scheme described here doesn't actually work all that
well. What I'm going to suggest is look at the jekyll plugin
[`hawkins`](https://github.com/awood/hawkins) for a really simple and
*working* method to get live reloading with everything working in
Jekyll.

Recently looking around, and chatting with some folks on the `#jekyll`
irc channel on freenode, I started to rethink the work I'd done
creating the [drink_up_doctor] gem using [Gulp] to drive the work cycle.


[Gulp]: http://gulpjs.com "The streaming build system"
[drink_up_doctor]: https://github.com/tamouse/drink_up_doctor "Build a new jekyll site that is driven with gulp"
[Guard]: http://guardgem.org/ "Guard is a command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications."

[Guard] is a tool for performing continuous testing on your local
machine while you're developing code. Some folks have written
extensions that let you continuously rebuild and view your work in a
browser while you're updating your Jekyll site.

Since the Gulp build system uses a *lot* of node.js modules, and they
take up a significant chunk of disk space in relation to most Jekyll
sites, it seems prudent to find something that's a little more
lightweight.

There are some good
[posts](http://dan.doezema.com/2014/01/setting-up-livereload-with-jekyll/)
out there on the subject of using Jekyll with Guard. Here's what I
discovered and set up, based on Dan's post, and a lot of reading of
source code.

* contents
{:toc}

## Starting out

I first created a new directory for the site.

    $ mkdir ~/Sites/test_jekyll_guard
    $ cd ~/Sites/test_jekyll_guard

## Git-ized it

    $ git init
    $ echo _site/ >> .gitignore
	$ git add .
    $ git commit -m "initial"

## Initialize `bundler`

    $ bundle init

## Edit the `Gemfile`

``` ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "jekyll"
gem "guard"
gem "guard-jekyll-plus"
gem "guard-livereload"
gem "rack-livereload"
gem "thin"
```

## Bundle it up

    $ bundle

## Created the `Guardfile`

``` ruby
guard 'livereload' do
  watch /.*/
end

guard 'jekyll-plus', serve: true do
  watch /.*/
  ignore /^_site/
end
```

## Built an empty jekyll site

    $ bundle exec jekyll new . --force --blank

## Made a `_config.yml` file

``` yaml
title: testing guard-livereload with jekyll

exclude:
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - Guardfile
  - README.md
```

## And fired up `guard`

``` bash
$ bundle exec guard
Configuration file: _config.yml
05:50:10 - INFO - Jekyll building...
05:50:10 - INFO - LiveReload is waiting for a browser to connect.
05:50:10 - INFO - Jekyll build completed in 0.01s /Users/tamara/Sites/test_jekyll_guard â†’ _site
05:50:10 - INFO - Jekyll Using: Rack::Handler::Thin as server
05:50:10 - INFO - Jekyll watching and serving using rack at 127.0.0.1:4000
05:50:10 - INFO - Jekyll watching
05:50:10 - INFO - Guard is now watching at '/Users/tamara/Sites/test_jekyll_guard'
[1] guard(main)> Thin web server (v1.6.4 codename Gob Bluth)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 127.0.0.1:4000, CTRL+C to stop
```

This starts up the jekyll server at it's usual place serving
`http://127.0.0.1:4000`, but before I could browse there, I needed to
add the LiveReload extension to my browser. I use Google Chrome, but
there are extensions for Firefox and others. Here I will simply point
elsewhere for installing the extension:
<http://livereload.com/extensions/>

## Browse to the site

Now fire up your browser to point at jekyll's server. I had to
initially click the livereload button that was on the toolbar. In
other browsers, there might be some other way to start it
listening. The output at your terminal will show:

``` bash
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Jan/2016:05:50:18 -0600] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0.0019
05:50:19 - INFO - Browser connected.

```

The page will be blank, because the `index.html` file is empty.

## Create some content

Let's create some content and see what happens.

### In `_layouts/default.html`


``` html
{% raw %}<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
	  content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <title>{{site.title}}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
{{content}}
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
```


### In `index.html`

``` html
{% raw %}---
layout: default
---

<h1>{{ site.title }}</h1>
<h2>It works!</h2>
{% endraw %}
```

## Watch it reload!

After saving these, your browser should reload a couple times and you
should see the site with your content.

When you're done working, you simple enter `quit` to tell Guard to
stop. (Note that it might look like it's in the middle of something,
but it's actually at a prompt. Just hit enter to see another
prompt. This screws me up all the time.)

## Conclusion

This is a lot more lightweight than using the Gulp build system with
BrowserSync, and only really requires manually opening the browser and
clicking on the livereload button to connect things (BrowserSync does
this automatically.) On this blog, still running the Gulp build
system, the `node_modules` directory takes up 105MB while the entire
site takes up 161MB, i.e., the node software is taking up
**two-thirds** of the space.
