Link to a tutuorial on CSS3 hover effects for image captions.

A recent
[tutorial](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/06/18/caption-hover-effects/)
on [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) by [Mary
Lou](http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/crnacura/) shows how to use
CSS3 transforms to create some subtle and rather stylish captions for
images when the user hovers over them.

<!--more-->

Provided is a [Github
repository](https://github.com/codrops/CaptionHoverEffects) of the
code used in the tutorial's examples, as well as a [demo](http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/CaptionHoverEffects/) of the
effects.

I am rather partial to this one:
