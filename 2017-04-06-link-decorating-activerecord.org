This came across my path this week:
[[https://robots.thoughtbot.com/authors/joel-quenneville][JoÃ«l
Quenneville]]'s article,
[[file:%7B%7B%20page.source%20%7D%7D][Decorating ActiveRecord]], which
outlines some hazards when you go about decorating ActiveRecord models.

Do read the article, it's good.

Here's the tl;dr for my memory:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If you're decorating an ActiveRecord or ActiveModel object in Rails,
  you probably want to define the following to ensure the decorator
  works the way you expect instead of silently delegating to the
  underlying object:
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <blockquote>
#+END_HTML

{% highlight ruby linenos %} class Profile < SimpleDelegator extend
ActiveModel::Naming

def to\_model self end end {% endhighlight %}

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </blockquote>
#+END_HTML
