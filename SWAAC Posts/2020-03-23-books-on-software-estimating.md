Someone was asking for some youtube / vimeos on software engineering. I don't have any. I learned this back in that dark ages.

My first thought was to head to [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition), and sure enough there is a section on estimating.

Next thought was look at [Code Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete), which also has an even more detailed look at estimating. The is also a section on **Additional Resources on Software Estimation**:

> Here are some additional references about software estimation:
> Boehm, Barry, et al. Software Cost Estimation with Cocomo II. Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2000. This book describes the ins and outs of the Cocomo II estimating model, which is undoubtedly the most popular model in use today.
> Boehm, Barry W. Software Engineering Economics. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1981. This older book contains an exhaustive treatment of software-project estimation considered more generally than in Boehm's newer book.
> Humphrey, Watts S. A Discipline for Software Engineering. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1995. Chapter 5 of this book describes Humphrey's Probe method, which is a technique for estimating work at the individual developer level.
> Conte, S. D., H. E. Dunsmore, and V. Y. Shen. Software Engineering Metrics and Models. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings, 1986. Chapter 6 contains a good survey of estimation techniques, including a history of estimation, statistical models, theoretically based models, and composite models. The book also demonstrates the use of each estimation technique on a database of projects and compares the estimates to the projects' actual lengths.
> Gilb, Tom. Principles of Software Engineering Management. Wokingham, England: Addison-Wesley, 1988. The title[…]”

These are old as the hills, being contemporary with my learning the craft. I met most of them, and spent time with Boehm, Humphrey, and Gilb while I was working with Hewlett-Packard.

For modern software estimating, especially in the world of web applications, Gilb is probably still the most germain.
