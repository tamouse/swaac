> A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first
> digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women
> studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But
> in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science
> flattened, and then plunged, even as the [share of women in other technical and professional fields](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/content.cfm?pub_id=4266&id=2)
> kept rising.
> 
> What happened?
> 
> We spent the last few weeks trying to answer this question, and there's
> no clear, single answer.
> 
> But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science
> started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers
> started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
> 
> These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could
> play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And
> these toys were marketed
> [almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CDkHs4lzUo)
> [entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxNjx_VWJ8U) to men and boys.
> 
> This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the
> story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define
> who geeks were and it created techie culture.
> 
> Movies like Weird Science, Revenge of the Nerds, and War Games all came
> out in the '80s. And the plot summaries are almost interchangeable:
> awkward geek boy genius uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and
> win the girl.

> In the 1990s, a researcher named [Jane Margolis](http://gseis.ucla.edu/directory/jane-margolis/)interviewed
> hundreds of computers science students at Carnegie Mellon, which had one
> of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much
> more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their
> girls were really interested in computers.
> 
> This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal
> computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly
> assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.
> 
> Patricia Ordóñez didn't have a computer at home, but she was a math wiz
> in school.
> 
> "My teacher realized I was really good at solving problems, so she
> pulled me and this other boy out to do special math," she says. "We did
> math instead of recess!"
> 
> So when Ordóñez got to Johns Hopkins in the '80s, she figured she would
> study computer science or electrical engineering. Then she took her
> first intro class — and found that most of her male classmates were way
> ahead of her because they'd grown up playing with computers.
> 
> "I remember this one time I asked a question and and the professor
> stopped and looked at me and said, 'You should know that by now," she
> recalls. "And I thought 'I am never going to excel.'"
> 
> In the '70s, that never would have happened: Professors in intro classes
> assumed their students came in with no experience. But by the '80s, that
> had changed.
> 
> Ordóñez got through the class but earned the first C in her life. She
> eventually dropped the program and majored in foreign languages.
> 
> More than a decade later, though, she returned to computers. She found a
> mentor, and eventually got a PhD in computer science. Now she's an
> assistant professor of computer science at the University of Puerto
> Rico.
