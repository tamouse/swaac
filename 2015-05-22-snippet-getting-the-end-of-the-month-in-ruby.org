You can easily get the end of the month, or end of the year, via sending
in a negative 1 to the various date and time constructors:

{% highlight ruby %} # Last day of 2015 Date.new(2015,12,-1).to\_s #=>
"2015-12-31"

* Last minute of 2015
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: last-minute-of-2015
  :END:

DateTime.new(2015,-1,-1,23,-1).to\_s #=> "2015-12-31T23:59:00+00:00" {%
endhighlight %}

/Note:/ this does not work with =Time.new=.
