  title: "The Manuscripts of Edsger W. Dijkstra"

> Dijkstra always believed it a scientist’s duty to maintain a
lively correspondence with his scientific colleagues. To a
greater extent than most of us, he put that conviction into
practice. For over four decades, he mailed copies of his
consecutively numbered technical notes, trip reports, insightful
observations, and pungent commentaries, known collectively as
“EWDs”, to several dozen recipients in academia and
industry. Thanks to the ubiquity of the photocopier and the wide
interest in Dijkstra’s writings, the informal circulation of many
of the EWDs eventually reached into the thousands.
