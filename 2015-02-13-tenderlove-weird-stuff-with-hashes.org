A great post from @tenderlove on some interesting performance aspects of
using strings for keys in hashes:

[[file:%7B%7B%20page.source%20%7D%7D][Weird stuff with hashes]]

tl;dr:

- Hashes dup string keys and then freeze them
- Creating a lot of hashes with string keys can become a big performance
  hit
- Freeze the string key so Hash won't dup it and reduce object
  allocations and hence calls to the GC
