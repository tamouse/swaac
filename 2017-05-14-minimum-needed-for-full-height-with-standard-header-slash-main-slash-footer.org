I figured this out once, but lost it somewhere, so I'm recording here
for sure: How to make a web page attain it's full height, with a page
header, page footer, and a main content section, so the footer will be
on the bottom if the main content section is not tall enough.

This was based off a [[file:%7B%7B%20page.css-tricks.href%20%7D%7D][{{
page.css-tricks.title }}]] article
[[file:%7B%7B%20page.source%20%7D%7D][{{ page.source\_title }}]]

Trying some a bit new, am using an embedded gist:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tamouse/ed0174615be56bc4309f5dff7537d03a.js"></script>
