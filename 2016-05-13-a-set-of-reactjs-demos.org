Recently, a friend and former co-worker of mine,
[[https://www.youtube.com/user/samowamoboy][Sam Slotsky]], put together
a set of intro demos and tutorials into using
[[http://reactjs.com][ReactJS]]. They're really pretty good at giving
someone experienced in JavaScript and web development a leg up on
learning ReactJS quickly.

Give them a watch and like them!
