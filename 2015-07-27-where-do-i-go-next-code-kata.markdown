Recently someone asked "I've completed the turtorials on Ruby, where
should I go next to continue learning?" A non-trivial question,
perhaps. Much of what you see when you google "Ruby tutorials" is the
very basic beginner's things. These are great, there is much to offer,
but then where do you go?

My response is: Practice.

Practice is how we turn the stuff we're learning into practical
skill. A lot of folks just start writing applications and so on, which
is really great. But for some, something more directed might be
needed.

There are a couple of places I'd like to highlight:

* [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/)
* [Exercism.IO](http://exercism.io)

*******

## [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/)

[Code Kata](http://codekata.com/) is Dave Thomas's (of the Pickaxe
book and Pragmatic Programmer's fame) list of exercises that one can
practice in *any* language, and do over and over again, trying out new
techniques, doing further analysis, seeing how you can get to the end
faster, and so on.

Kata are not about creating an end point, they are about practicing
the techniques of software programming: testing, analysis, editing,
and all those things. Maybe you want to try a different testing
technique, maybe you want to try a different test platform, a
different editor or IDE, and so on.

Even just working them live for an audience over and over again can be
quite revealing to yourself and to your audience.

Dave's list is pretty great.

## [Exercism.IO](http://exercism.io)

Katrina Owen's [Exercism.IO](http://exercism.io) is a bit different,
because it also includes feedback for what you've written. Similarly
to the kata, there are a set of given exercises to do. The difference
is that you submit your solutions and have them critiqued by other
coders.

You are presented with a framework of tests that your implementation
needs to pass, and guidance through the example.

When you submit your implementation, then you'll start to receive
comments on your implementation, how you can improve it, and so on.

As you progress, you are also given the chance to provide feedback to
others. In the grand tradition of surgical training: See one. Do
one. Teach one.

Recently I viewed Jim Weirich's talk at RubyConf India 2013 where he
showed one of his kata, converting to and from roman numerals, in a
public demonstration of how to practice. It's really a great talk,
typical Jim, and well worth watching the entire thing:

I want to highlight the [learning]({{site.baseurl | append: "/pages/learning/" }})
page I've put up here as well, for a list of other resources.
