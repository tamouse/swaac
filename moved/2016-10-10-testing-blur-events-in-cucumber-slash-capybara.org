After banging my head on this problem for a long time, chasing blog posts, stackoverflow, lots of opinions, bug reports, and so on, I finally asked my workmates, and together we arrived at a method that works.

** The Problem
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-problem
   :END:

There is apparently a bug, although it's marked as INVALID in bugzilla, that prevents =focus()= and =blur()= events from being executed directly when the test browser is not focused.

The links I chased:

- https://github.com/mattheworiordan/jquery-focus-selenium-webkit-fix/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/jquery.focus.test-fix.js
- https://makandracards.com/makandra/12661-how-to-solve-selenium-focus-issues

And many many more...

** What worked
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: what-worked
   :END:

The most obviously glaring thing to do is *NOT* make this event happen via executing a JS script, but by simply *SENDING A TAB*.

Here's the step:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    When(/^I unfocus field (.*?)$/) do |field_name|
      field = page.find_field(field_name)
      field.native.send_keys :tab
    end
#+END_SRC

That did the trick, and now we all have an uncle Bob.

Thanks Nic and JD
