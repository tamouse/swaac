Beware the /F/lash /O/f /U/nstyled /T/ext! That moment of flicker on your page before your webfonts have downloaded and the screen is showoing your fallback font.

[[https://twitter.com/notwaldorf][Monica Dinculescu]] has written a nice tool that /shows/ how your lovely chosen webfont will FOUT (yeah, I just verbed that acronym) against your backup font, but more interestingly, /what you can do about it/.

Here's a screenshot comparing Impact and Montserrat:
