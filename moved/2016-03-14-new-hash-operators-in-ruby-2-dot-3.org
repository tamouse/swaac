There are some new Hash operators in Ruby 2.3:

Subset operators:

- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-3C][=<=]] - hash is a subset of other
- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-3C-3D][=<==]] - hash is a subset or equal to other
- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-3E][=>=]] - other is a subset of hash
- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-3E-3D][=>==]] - other is a subset or equal to hash

Others:

- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-dig][=dig=]] - "Extracts the nested value specified by the sequence of /idx/ objects by calling =dig= at each step, returning =nil= if any intermediate step is =nil=."
- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-fetch_values][=fetch_values=]] - "Returns an array containing the values associated with the given keys but also raises =KeyError= when one of keys can't be found. Also see =Hash#values_at= and =Hash#fetch=."
- [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html#method-i-to_proc][=to_proc=]] - this isn't documented, it seems
