An overview of the four most common JavaScript-based task runners in use today:

- Grunt
- Gulp
- Webpack
- npm scripts

Why limit it to JS-based? Because they will run on all the OSes as well, not just the classic *nix-based distros.

Personally, I'm loving [[https://webpack.github.io/][Webpack]] with npm scripts these days. :)
