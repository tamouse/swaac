I'm forwarding (from an e-mail) an opportunity to attend a workshop for folks who are at the very beginning of learning web design, or are asking the quesiton "Where do I begin?".

I recently attended a Front End Masters event, and it was the sort of thing I enjoy: informal, lots of interaction, great workshop leaders, people with something to say.
