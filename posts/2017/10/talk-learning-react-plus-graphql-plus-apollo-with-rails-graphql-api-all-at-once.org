Last month, September 2017, I gave a talk twice on my experiences learning React, GraphQl, Apollo Client, along with installing a GraphQL API to an ancient legacy app, all at once.

The version of the talk I gave at the JavaScript MN meetup was recorded, and you can see it here: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udMfM4rh_1g]]

The version I gave the prior Monday at the Ruby MN meetup was much longer, and included quite a bit of information on the Ruby GraphQL API. Maybe someday it will all get filmed. :D

In the meantime, the slides are up on Github at [[https://tamouse.github.io/Talk-Rails-GraphQL-React/#/]] (The slide repo is at [[https://github.com/tamouse/Talk-Rails-GraphQL-React]].)

The repo that contains my sandbox / learning application is at [[https://github.com/tamouse/r5_graphql_react]].
