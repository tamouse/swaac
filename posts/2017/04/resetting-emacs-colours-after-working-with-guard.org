This is a petty annoyance, but those add up.

After I've been using [[https://github/guard/guard][guard]], it leaves the last status notification on my emacs mode line, so I want to reset it so I can stop thinking about the project for a while.

I found something like this and wrote it for my needs:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tamouse/4eaa00af7b415fc48ac03bcb97a4c2ac.js"></script>
#+END_HTML

I save the script in my =$HOME/bin/= folder and can call it from the command line to clean up my emacs mode line.
