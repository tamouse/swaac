So today I learned that one should pay closer attention to what the documetation says instead of just assuming you already know. RTFM\^2.

In Capybara, you can fill in fields in forms using the =.fill_in()= method. In [[http://www.rubydoc.info/github/teamcapybara/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions#fill_in-instance_method][the documentation]] it discusses the types of locators you can use:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Locate a text field or text area and fill it in with the given text The field can be found via its name, id or label text.
#+END_QUOTE

It doesn't say /anything/ about using a CSS selector!

So: this does not work:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    @modal.fill_in("#new-job-number-input-#{@job.id}", with: "999")
#+END_SRC

But this, however, *DOES* work:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    @modal.fill_in("new-job-number-input-#{@job.id}", with: "999")
#+END_SRC

That one, single "#" at the beginning of the string was throwing me off, causing me to reach for other sorts of shenannigans to find the field to fill in.

Hooray, persistence!
