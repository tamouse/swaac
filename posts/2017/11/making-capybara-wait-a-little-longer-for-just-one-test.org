I needed to add some time to a Capybara test that was checking some AJAX in my code. I didn't want to increase the waiting time overall, just for this one particular transaction.

Capybara has a =default_wait_time= setting in the configuration, so it makes sense there's a way to set wait time some other way that's /not/ the default.

I couldn't find anything in the readme, and I didn't know what to search for in the docs. I entered a general set of search terms in google, to no particular avail. I finally settled on the rather brute force desperation "How do I change Capybara's wait time for just one test?" and got a page at reddit that covered it exactly: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/25xrdy/is_there_a_way_to_change_capybaras_wait_time_just/]]

The top two answers provide the best solutions, I think, as they expose features available in Capybara that I didn't know existed.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    Capybara.using_wait_time(n) do
      # .. run your test in this block
      # .. and it will wait n seconds
      # .. for items to appear in the page
    end
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    expect(page).to have_selector("#my_thing", wait: 5)
      # .. the above will wait 5 seconds for
      # .. `#my_button` item to appear on the page
#+END_SRC

Pretty dang cool!
