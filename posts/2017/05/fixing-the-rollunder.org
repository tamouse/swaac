* Fixing the Roll-under for Fixed-Top Layouts

A typical problem encountered when using something like [[https://getbootstrap.com][Bootstrap's]] fixed-top navbar is that clicking on an interior link often causes that link target to scroll underneath the navbar, hiding it from view.

The fix for this is a bit of a hack, and sometimes you need to adjust things even further.

** Targeting the link targets

Sounds redundant, but what I mean is how I want to set some CSS to apply to all the interior link targets.

The way Bootstrap purports to do this (but I haven't seen it on versions I've been using) is a general selection targetting items with an =id= attribute.

This works well using a package like [[http://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]] with the [[][Kramdown]] markdown processor which adds an =id= attribute to every Markdown heading.

(This is SCSS code which uses the =$navbar-height= variable defined by bootstrap. In plain old CSS you'd just use the number.)

#+BEGIN_SRC scss
  ,*[id]:before {
      display: block;
      content: " ";
      margin-top: -($navbar-height+25); // Set the Appropriate Height
      height: ($navbar-height+25); // Set the Appropriate Height
      visibility: hidden;
  }
#+END_SRC

So whereever there's a element with the =id= tag now, there's an invisible CSS =:before= section that pushes the item down. It's invisibility also means that it won't cover any links or clickable items that might be just above the heading.

One problem I did run into was using the table of contents generator in Kramdown:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  ,* Content
  {:toc}
#+END_SRC

This creates a list of interior page links, but also puts an =id= attribute on each link in the list item, so adding this reversed the effect of the prior "push down", so that the list bullets aligned with the list items.

#+BEGIN_SRC scss
  li *[id]:before {
      display: inherit;
      content: '';
      margin-top: 0;
      height: 0;
      visibility: hidden;
  }
#+END_SRC
