Something I had tucked away in notes on a different computer while I was working on my work computer, so I figured it was time to put up on the SWaaC blog.

By default on macOS, when you do a screen capture, it saves the file(s) in your Desktop directory. I'd like to put them someplace else as I really hate having cluttered up desktops.

The command to use from the Terminal is =defaults= which is used to set various system parameters that aren't available in Systems Preferences.

Here's what I did:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  $ mkdir ~/Pictures/Screenshots
  $ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/Screenshots
  $ killall SystemUIServer
#+END_SRC

and to test took a screen capture with CMD-SHIFT-3.

I considered saving the screen captures to my Google Drive, but that might prove to be a problem at some point down the road.

Also, I'm using an app called [[https://monosnap.com/welcome][Monosnap]] which is freely available from the App Store for making annotated screen captures. I'm liking it a lot, it reminds me of Skitch for Evernote, without the Evernote overhead.
