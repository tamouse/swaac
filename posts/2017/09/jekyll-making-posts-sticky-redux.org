[[./2013-09-28-jekyll-making-posts-sticky.markdown][Last time]], I talked about using categories to make a post sticky. This eats up a category, though, and can make the post's permalink look silly.

** Use a Page Variable
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-a-page-variable
   :END:

This time, we're just going to use a page variable to do it.

In your posts that you want to be sticky, add a page variable to the front matter:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  ---
  layout: post
  sticky: true
  # ...
  ---
#+END_SRC


Then in your page where you want the sticky posts to appear first, use the following template:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  {% for post in site.posts %}{% if post.sticky %}
  ,* [{{post.title}}]({{post.url}}) {{post.date|date_to_string}}
  {% endif %}{% endfor %}

  {% for post in site.posts %}{% unless post.sticky %}
  ,* [{{post.title}}]({{post.url}}) {{post.date|date_to_string}}
  {% endunless %}{% endfor %}
  {% endraw %}
#+END_SRC

If you wanted the sticky posts to show up again in the lower section, just remove the =unless-endunless= condition in the second loop.

** Use a Collection
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-a-collection
   :END:

The above solution is still a bit crude, and doesn't really lend itself to pagination.

Perhaps a better solution to try for is set up a collection of sticky posts and deal with them completely separately from your regular posts.

In =_config.yml=

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  collections:
    - important
#+END_SRC

Create the sticky posts in the =_important= folder like regular posts.

The file you want to show the sticky and regular post then can have the following construction:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  {% for post in site.important %}
  ,* [{{post.title}}]({{post.url}}) {{post.date|date_to_string}}
  {% endfor %}

  {% for post in site.posts %}
  ,* [{{post.title}}]({{post.url}}) {{post.date|date_to_string}}
  {% endfor %}
  {% endraw %}
#+END_SRC

Works with Jekyl 3.5.2. YMMV.
