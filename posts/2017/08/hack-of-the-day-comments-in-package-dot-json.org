You know how you can't have JavaScript comments in a .JSON file? Sometimes you want them, thus this hack for ~package.json~.

I'm probably not the first person to think of this, but no one's ever suggested it to me.[fn:1]

JSON files cannot have comments. But many of our configuration files are in JSON, and could benefit from some commentary. For example, why did you nail that particular version of ~webpack-dev-server~ ? (A true story that happened today.)

Comments are a sometimes good, sometimes bad thing. I like comments that give explanations for why things are the way they are, not so much what things are, or how things are done.

In this case, I wanted to leave a breadcrumb where my project mates (now and future) would be able to find some reason for a particular version being nailed instead of being allowed to increase with minor version changes.

The ~package.json~ file has a set of required keys (see [[https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json]] for details). It doesn't seem to mind if there are other keys, in fact several other things utilize keys to configure themselves (e.g.Â Jest).

There isn't a "comments" key, however.

So I decided to make use of it in our ~package.json~ file by creating an array of comments offering that "wth were you thinking" commentary for future devs.

Here's the top fragment of the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  {
      "comments" : [
          "There is a bug in webpack-dev-server v2.7.0: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/1025",
          "Nailing redux to v3.5.2 because v3.7.1 is breaking the dispatch maps"
      ],
      "name": "Example"
  }
#+END_SRC

and the regular parts of the file continue after that.

I think I'll improve on that by adding the branch / commit where those comments come into play.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Remember that? Someone else /did/ think of it, and it might be even better:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  {
      "//": "another way of putting comments in",
      "name": "Example"
  }
#+END_SRC
