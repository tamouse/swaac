* Finding records

In Rails, you probably don't want to get all the records from a model when your database becomes large.
E.g. fetching a million rows will make a very large object space in your application, since Rails (ActiveRecord)
is converting each row to an object.

Instead, ActiveRecord provides a couple of methods to handle this.

1. ~find_in_batches~
2. ~find_each~

** Which one should you use?

Almost all the time, you can safely choose ~find_each~, since it calls ~find_in_batches~ under the hood and loops through each record in the batch and yields the record to you.
