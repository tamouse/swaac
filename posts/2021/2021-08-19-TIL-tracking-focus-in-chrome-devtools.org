Last updated: 2021-08-19T17:22:44-05:00

When you're tabbing, about, sometimes you lose the little focus ring because that hasn't been implemented for the item.

[[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/focus/][This post]] describes how you can see the current tab focus in Chrome devtools.

In a nutshell:

1. Open devtools Console
2. Click on *Create a Live Expression*
3. Enter ~document.activeElement~ in the input box
4. Click outside the Live Expression UI to save
