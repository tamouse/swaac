Today's post is borrowed from [Greg's Wiki]({{ page.source }}]) and
represents a very common problem encountered in inhabiting spaces for
helping people with problems and getting help yourself.


> The X-Y Problem, as it is sometimes called, is a mental block which

> * User wants to do X.
> * User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
> * User doesn't know how to do Y either.
> * User asks for help with Y.
> * Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.

> After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear

> suitable solution for X.

> The problem occurs when people get their train of thought stuck on

This X-Y problem is a bit of cognitive snafu that happens to everyone
when trying to track down a problem. There's even a familiar phrase
that was popular among organization and process improvement folks in
the 80s and 90s: "When you're up to your ass in aligators, it's hard
to remember the job was to drain the swamp."

Greg's [page]({{ page.source }}) shows some really great examples of this sort of thing as
it seems to happen a lot in IRC chat rooms.

To get unstuck can be hard, but remember when you find yourself deep
down into the 3rd or 5th
[yak at the barbershop](http://catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html),
ask yourself: "What am I trying to accomplish?" or "What's the purpose
of doing this?", or to the 5-why thing by asking "Why am I doing
this?" five times.

[Perlmonks](http://www.perlmonks.org) also has a whole
[batch of examples](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=XY+Problem).
