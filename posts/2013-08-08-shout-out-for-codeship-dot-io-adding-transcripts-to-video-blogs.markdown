In which your humble correspondent sings the praises for some people
really trying to get it.

The folks over at [CodeshipIO](http://blog.codeship.io/) run a weekly
series called ["Testing Tuesday"](http://blog.codeship.io/category/testing-tuesday) 
that I really enjoy. It is a video lesson, which I often have a hard
time following due to a bit of hearing loss and just the way I process
things. I left a comment asking if they could do transcripts, not
really expecting much because it's just these guys with their
business, ya know?

Well, I got back an [enthusiastic reply](http://blog.codeship.io/2013/07/23/testing-tuesday-15-how-to-set-up-cucumber.html#comment-982695501)
and they've agreed to start putting up transcripts!

Well done, Codeship! 

There's some improvements to be made, as with anything, and I hope
they'll be able to keep it going alongside the videos. The series
itself is awesome and I highly recommend it to people who want to get
their game on in continuous testing.

Again, thank you, Codeship, very well done!
