[Victor Felder](https://github.com/vhf) has taken his list of
[Free Programming Books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)
and put it on Github for collaborative updating. (Seems it is going
into other languages quite a bit.) This is a great resource for folks
looking to learn something technical.
