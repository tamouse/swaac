I started a new thing: an "Ask Me Anything" github repo where you can
ask me any question as an issue, I'll try to answer it.

I got the idea from
reading [@notwaldorf](https://github.com/notwaldorf)'s site about the
[font-style-matcher](https://github.com/notwaldorf/font-style-matcher)
tool she wrote (which you should also check out).

If you have questions, [ask me!](https://github.com/tamouse/ama/issues/new)
