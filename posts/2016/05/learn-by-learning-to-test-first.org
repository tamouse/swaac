In a recent mailing, [[http://www.ultrasaurus.com/][Sarah Allen]] mentioned the work she's done to teach Ruby and JavaScript from the "test-first" orientation. The [[file:%7B%7Bpage.link.href%7D%7D][link]] is the result of that work.

If you're just learning Ruby or JavaScript and looking for a "what's next?" then give this a try. Testing is hugely important in any software development, and the Test First philosophy is well-founded.
