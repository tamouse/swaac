  We occasionally have students ask for help on software, "My software is perfect, but it doesn't work!" Your software is never perfect. My own software is never perfect. I recently found that I made someone's top ten list with regard to software that I had written 37 years ago. It's not a top ten list anyone would aspire to be listed on. Software that I wrote in 1979 is number two on this list of ten historical software bugs with extreme consequences. I learned some very important lessons from that experience.
