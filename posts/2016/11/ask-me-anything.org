I started a new thing: an "Ask Me Anything" github repo where you can ask me any question as an issue, I'll try to answer it.

I got the idea from reading [@notwaldorf](https://github.com/notwaldorf)'s site about the [[https://github.com/notwaldorf/font-style-matcher][font-style-matcher]] tool she wrote (which you should also check out).

If you have questions, [[https://github.com/tamouse/ama/issues/new][ask me!]]
