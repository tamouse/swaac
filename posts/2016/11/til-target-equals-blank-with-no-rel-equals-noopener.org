In yesterdays CSS-Tricks column [[https://css-tricks.com/random-interesting-facts-htmlsvg-usage/][Random Interesting Facts on HTMLSVG usage CSS-Tricks]], Catalin Rosu explains something I'd never heard before, and it can be pretty important:

  target=_blank w/ or w/o rel=noopener

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  43,924,869 of the anchors we analyzed are using target="_blank" without a rel="noopener" conjunction. In this case, if rel="noopener" is missing, you are leaving your users open to a phishing attack and it's considered a security vulnerability.

    When using target you should consider adding rel="noopener noreferrer" to avoid exploitation of the window.opener API.

  [[https://dev.to/ben/the-targetblank-vulnerability-by-example][Ben Halpern]] and [[https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/][Mathias Bynens]] also wrote some good articles on this matter and the common advice is: don't use target=_blank, unless you have good reasons.

I may need to rethink how I often I use =target="_blank"=. Lately I've been creating slide presentations using =reveal.js= and I include links in the slide show; I think it's easier for students if I open up a new tab rather than interrupting the flow of the slide show.

I think for those, I'll go ahead an add the recommended =rel="noopener noreferrer"=. But elsewhere, I'll consider curtailing my use of =target="_blank"=
