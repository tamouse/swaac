*WARNING: This is old and likely obsolete.*

In the past, when I've wanted to create a verse, perhaps in a blockquote I've resorted to using ~<br>~ on every line, which is tedious:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  > Listen, little children, all,<br>
  > Listen to our earnest call:<br>
  > You are very young, 'tis true,<br>
  > But there's much that you can do.<br>
  > Even you can plead with men<br>
  > That they buy not slaves again,<br>
  > And that those they have may be<br>
  > Quickly set at liberty.<br>

#+END_SRC

In ~kramdown~, the default markdown processor in [[Jekyll]] these days, there's an easier way:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  > Listen, little children, all,
  > Listen to our earnest call:
  > You are very young, 'tis true,
  > But there's much that you can do.
  > Even you can plead with men
  > That they buy not slaves again,
  > And that those they have may be
  > Quickly set at liberty.
  {: style="white-space: pre-line"}
#+END_SRC
