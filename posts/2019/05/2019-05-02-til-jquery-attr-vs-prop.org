** Intro

   Sometime in the past, jQuery only had an ~.attr()~ method for looking at and setting an element's attributes. More recently, it acquired the ~.prop()~ method for setting a node's properties.

** Radio Button example

   The problem I ran into this with was old code that dealt with toggling radio buttons on a form:

    #+BEGIN_SRC rjsx
      $('#customer_which_billing_address_service').attr('checked', true);
    #+END_SRC

    This would set the sense of the attribute in the source, but it wouldn't change the property, so the radio button remained unchecked visually; in addition, when the form was submitted the radio buttons set didn't get posted correctly.

    Changing this to the ~.prop()~ method fixed both problems:

    #+BEGIN_SRC rjsx
      $('#customer_which_billing_address_parent').prop('checked', false);
      $('#customer_which_billing_address_service').prop('checked', true);
    #+END_SRC

    This visually set the proper radio button, and when the form was submitted the correct radio button value was posted.
