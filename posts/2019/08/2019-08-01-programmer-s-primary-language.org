** What's a Programmer's Primary Language?

*Profanity*

So that's a really old joke, and I'd thought I'd written something about it long ago.

There's a funny comic that goes around from time to time (I'd thought it was one of Randall Monroe's, but it's not): https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/

It's often sourced from [[http://commadot.com/wtf-per-minute/][this blog entry]] with a computer-drawn version, but I rather like the original.
