I was working on a replacement for the ~Modal~ component in ~react-bootstrap~ since it is clear the library is moving away from where we want to be with our app.

While doing so, I noticed it was difficult to find the Portal that react creates in the DOM tree, since I was using just a regular old ~<div>~ element. Given in HTML5 you can invent your own HTML tag names (which Web Components and CSS Components take advantage of as well).

So I called the created element ~<modal-portal>~ and it's quite visible when it shows up in the DOM, and it makes an easy grab handle for testing.

In my ~ModalPortal~ component, the code looks like this:

#+name: ModalPortal.js
#+begin_src rjsx
    constructor(props) {
      super(props)
      this.el = document.createElement("modal-portal")
      this.modalRoot = document.querySelector(this.props.selector || "body")
    }
#+end_src

In the DOM, the component looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <modal-portal>
    <div class="modal fade in" style="display: block;">...</div>
  </modal-portal>
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_COMMENT
