** TIL: Firefox disables the meta refresh header by default

This came up with a story I was implementing, where we wanted an interstitial page to show up after a new client signs up for our product, basically a "Thank You" page, which is needed for tracking stuff in google analytics.

I thought to use the ~meta http-equiv=refresh~ header, which I've used for a very long time. Come to learn, however, the the Firefox browser disables this header by default.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29645340/why-does-meta-refresh-not-work-in-firefox

Because we don't want to force users to update their browser configurations before signing up for an account, I used the JavaScript redirect method instead.

I really hope browser writers don't decide that method is too risky for browser users; it would mean a lot of client apps might no longer work all of a sudden.

This is why we can't have nice things :(
