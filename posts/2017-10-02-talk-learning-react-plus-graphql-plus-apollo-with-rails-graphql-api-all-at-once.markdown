Last month, September 2017, I gave a talk twice on my experiences
learning React, GraphQl, Apollo Client, along with installing a
GraphQL API to an ancient legacy app, all at once.

The version of the talk I gave at the JavaScript MN meetup was
recorded, and you can see it
here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udMfM4rh_1g>

The version I gave the prior Monday at the Ruby MN meetup was much
longer, and included quite a bit of information on the Ruby GraphQL
API. Maybe someday it will all get filmed. :D

In the meantime, the slides are up on Github
at <https://tamouse.github.io/Talk-Rails-GraphQL-React/#/> (The slide
repo is at <https://github.com/tamouse/Talk-Rails-GraphQL-React>.)

The repo that contains my sandbox / learning application is
at <https://github.com/tamouse/r5_graphql_react>.
