* Braintree

   Braintree is a payment processing gateway that is pretty useful. Some
   things I've learned:

** Braintree Dev Notes
*** Getting rid of those log messages during dev/test

     You can set the Braintree logger in the configuration:

     #+begin_src ruby
       require 'logger'

       Braintree::Configuration.logger = Logger.new(Rails.root.join("log/braintree_#{Rails.env}.log"))
     #+end_src

     This will set the logging level to DEBUG, which prints out the
     response body, which can be pretty useful. however, it's a bit
     noisy, too. Easy enogh to set the log level:

     #+begin_src ruby
       Braintree::Configuration.logger.level = Logger::INFO
     #+end_src
