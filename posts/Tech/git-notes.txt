    As noted previously, pass in the --no-commit flag, but to avoid a fast-forward commit, also pass in --no-ff, like so:

    $ git merge --no-commit --no-ff $BRANCH
    To examine the staged changes:

    $ git diff --cached
    And you can undo the merge, even if it is a fast-forward merge:

    $ git merge --abort

    #+END_QUOTE

    Pretty straight-forward.
