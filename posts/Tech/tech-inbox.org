   7. Google Sheets API Instead Of CMS

      Some projects require you to think outside the box. When Adam Quinlan was working on a site for a restaurant where the owner needed a CMS to edit the specials menu on a daily basis, Adam decided to not use a bloated CMS but a Google sheet instead. This makes the site easy to edit while it remains flat from static side generators. Nice!
