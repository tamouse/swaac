** Postgresql Notes

*** Logging

    At some point on a project we had to look at the what the (rails)
    application was doing in the data base and needed to learn how to
    turn on logging.

    [[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-logging.html][Postgres logging]]

*** Timestamp Accuracy

 I had a question regarding the precision on Postgresql's timestamp (or
 timestamp with timezone) data type. It's described in the docs at
 [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype-datetime.html][Section 8.5 Date/Time Types]].

 The timestamp is 14 digits with 1 microsecond precision.

 I wrote a quick Rails app to see what happens for ~created_at~ in data
 base tables. Inserting (creating) 50 new records always increased the
 time stamp, there were no duplicates in timestamp.
