* Vagrant Notes
** Making Vagrant boxes go faster

  The typical defaults in the Vagrantfile create a wimpy box.

  My mac has a boatload of RAM and CPU cores to spare, thus making this a better config for working:


#+begin_src diff
   config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
-    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 1024]
+    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 4096, "--vram", 12, "--cpus", 4, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
   end
#+end_src

** Using a resolver to set the box's IP address
    Instead of hard wiring in an IP address for the vagrant box, you
    can have it look up a name in your host machine's /etc/hosts file,
    thusly:

    At the top of the Vagrant file:
    #+begin_src ruby
      require 'resolve'
    #+end_src

    Then, inside the box configuration:
    #+begin_src ruby
      config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", "--natdnsresolver1", "on"]
        #...
      end

      config.vm.network :private_network, ip: Resolv.getaddress('<vagrant box name from hosts>')
    #+end_src

    And in your /etc/hosts file:

    #+begin_src
      192.168.80.80	<vagrant box name>
    #+end_src

    Set the IP address to an appropriate setting for your local
    network, and give the vagrant box a suitable name for your project
    and the local network. Using ".dev" as the tld should be good.
