*** Practical Object Oriented Design in Rails - Sandi Metz

***** On composition vs inheritance, Sandi Metz in POODR
   #+begin_src markdown
     > Composition allows you to combine small parts to create more complex
     > objects such that the whole becomes more than the sum of its
     > parts. Composed objects tend to consist of simple, discrete entities
     > that can easily be rearranged into new combinations. These simple
     > objects are easy to understand, reuse, and test, but because they
     > combine into a more complicated whole, the operation of the bigger
     > application may not be as easy to understand as that of the
     > individual parts.


     > Composition, classical inheritance, and behavior sharing via modules
     > are competing techniques for arranging code. Each has different
     > costs and benefits; these differences predispose them to be better
     > at solving slightly different problems.


     > These techniques are tools, nothing more, and you’ll become a better
     > designer if you practice each of them. Learning to use them properly
     > is a matter of experience and judgment, and one of the best ways to
     > gain experience is to learn from your own mistakes. The key to
     > improving your design skills is to attempt these techniques, accept
     > your errors cheerfully, remain detached from past design decisions,
     > and refactor mercilessly.

     > As you gain experience, you’ll get better at choosing the correct
     > technique the first time, your applications will improve.”

*** The Well Grounded Rubyist

     #+begin_src markdown
       ## Who should read this book

       > The Well-Grounded Rubyist, Second Edition is optimized for a reader
       > who’s done some programming and perhaps even some Ruby and wants to
       > learn more about the Ruby language—not only the specific techniques
       > (although the book includes plenty of those), but also the design
       > principles that make Ruby what it is. I’m a great believer in knowing
       > what you’re doing. I also believe that knowing what you’re doing
       > doesn’t mean you have to compose a treatise in your head every time
       > you write a line of code; it means you know how to make the most out
       > of the language, and understand how to analyze problems when they
       > arise.
       >
       >
       > [I]f this is your first foray into programming, be prepared to do a
       > little extra self-imposed “homework” to get ramped up into the
       > programming process—but by all means, give The Well-Grounded Rubyist,
       > Second Edition a go. The book isn’t specifically an introduction to
       > programming, but it does take you through all the practicalities,
       > including the creation and running of program files, as well as
       > explaining Ruby from the ground up
