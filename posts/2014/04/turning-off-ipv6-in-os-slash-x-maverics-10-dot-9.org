I recently had a problem connecting via wi-fi at a local restaurant. This is how I solved it.

Apple's OS/X 10.9 Maverics seems to have produces many networking problems for people, myself included.

This particular problem arose when I was at a local favourite restaurant that offered wi-fi connectivity. I haven't encountered this elsewhere (yet), but I'm cataloging this so if others encounter the problem, this might be one way to fix it.

** The Problem
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-problem
   :END:

Networking could find the wi-fi and it would connect to the WAP, but it would not connect through to the Internet.

Initially, I thought it might be the WAP/Router/Modem in the restaurant, but when I tried to connect with my smartphone to the wi-fi, there was no problem getting through.

** Enter IPv6
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: enter-ipv6
   :END:

When I looked at the connection on my phone, I noticed it had an IPv4 number, while the mac was trying to connect using IPv6.

The symptoms were that the wi-fi would connect, get an IPv6 number, then in a little bit would fail-over to a non-connected IPv6 number. The IPv4 number coming was the default internal IPv4 number, showing no connection.

** Turning off IPv6
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: turning-off-ipv6
   :END:

It used to be easy to turn off IPv6 in future versions of OS/X. I'm not sure when it disappeared, but you cannot simply turn it off via the System Preferences Network Pane anymore.

A quick search of the web provided an answer:

#+END_EXAMPLE

The thing to do is to use command line to turn it off:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    networksetup -setv6off wi-fi
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Turning IPv6 back on
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: turning-ipv6-back-on
   :END:

It is probably /not/ a good idea to leave IPv6 off for any particular interface, so turning it back on is another command line:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    networksetup -setv6on wi-fi
#+END_EXAMPLE
