Something that comes up quite often on IRC is the question: "How do I get a job programming Ruby?", usually from people new to programming. I decided to post my response.

1. Get a [[https://github.com][github]] account.
2. Contribute to open source projects on github.
3. Build a portfolio on your github account:

   - Project contributions
   - Your own projects
   - Use [[https://pages.github.com][Github Pages]] to show what you are learning
   - Use [[https://gist.github.com][gists]] liberally to show snippets of work, scripts, one-liners, etc

4. Attend local events, network with people you want to work with.
5. Help out at local events. If there are no events local to you start one.
6. Do [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=informational+interviewing][informational interviews]].
7. Attend [[http://rubyconferences.org/][conferences]] , help out at conferences.
8. Help people on IRC, StackOverflow, etc.

*IOW*: Build a solid reputation that sells /you/.

*AND*: don't say "I can't" to these, the main thing about becoming a programmer is /solving problems/. This is just another kind of problem, figure out how to solve it.
