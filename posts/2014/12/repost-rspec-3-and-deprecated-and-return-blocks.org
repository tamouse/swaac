Over at the [[http://owowthathurts.blogspot.com/2014/08/rspec-3-and-deprecated-andreturn-blocks.html][ow ow! that hurts! blog]] , a nice little tidbit of information on a difference between RSpec version 2 and version 3:

** RSpec 3 and Deprecated .and_return Blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rspec-3-and-deprecated-.and_return-blocks
   :END:

 A deprecation warning I received after upgrading RSpec:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     `and_return { value }` is deprecated. Use `and_return(value)` or
     an implementation block without `and_return` instead
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 An example of code it's complaining about:

 #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     @mock_thing.should_receive(:something).and_return do
       double("SomeKindOfRelationship").tap do | mock_assoc |
         mock_assoc.should_receive(:where).and_return([ @mock_relationship ])
       end
     end
 #+END_SRC

 To fix, just remove the =.and_return=:

 #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     @mock_thing.should_receive(:something) do
       double("SomeKindOfRelationship").tap do | mock_assoc |
         mock_assoc.should_receive(:where).and_return([ @mock_relationship])
       end
     end
 #+END_SRC

 Of course, make sure your tests pass after the change.
