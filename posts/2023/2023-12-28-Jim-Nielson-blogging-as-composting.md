# From Jim Nielson: Blogging and Composting

Really interesting thought from Jim Nielson on comparing the posts you get from doing a thing that aren't the thing and writing a blog post about the experience. 

> Here’s a thought: blogging is like compositing.
> 
> The banana is what you’re after.
> 
> But as a byproduct of the banana you get the peel.
> 
> And if you compost, you can make good use of the peel.
> 
> Similarly, whatever you’re building is what you’re after.
> 
> But as a byproduct of whatever you’re building you undoubtedly learned, observed, or cursed at something along the way.
> 
> And if you blog, you can make good use of that experience!
> 
> Even if the banana was spoiled when you opened it, you can still compost it.
> 
> Similarly, even if you ship nothing, there’s a bpost in that failure-to-ship.
> 
> Composting recycles organic materials to enrich future plant soil.
> 
> Similarly, blogging recycles experience to enrich future projects (and self) with wisdom.
 

This really solidifies the experience, as a way of reviewing what you went through and turning it into words to explain it to someone else. I like to think of my audience as me before I started the project.
