A question that gets raised frequently in the #jekyll channel on
freenode is: "What can I use that makes it easy for users / clients to
maintian their content?".

Fair question, and though I haven't done this personally, there's
still some pretty good things out there someone can use to set this up
for their clients.

Two that come to mind are:

- [prose.io](http://prose.io) <small>[github repo](https://github.com/prose/prose)</small>
- [cloudcannon:](http://cloudcannon.com)
