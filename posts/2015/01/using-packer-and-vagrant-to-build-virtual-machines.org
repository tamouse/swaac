The great [[http://www.codeship.com][codeship.com]]'s [[http://blog.codeship.com/author/florianmotlik/][Florian Motlik]] writes a superb tutorial on building virtual machines with [[http://vagrantup.com][Vagrant]] and [[http://www.packer.io][Packer]]. Being able to swiftly build virtual machines is something I find essential for development, test, staging, and deployment.
