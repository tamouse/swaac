[[http://www.emacswiki.org][Emacs]] is my favourite editor, having imprinted on it way back in 1984 as my first editor on a Unix system. Emacs's [[http://www.orgmode.org][Org mode]] is something I've heard of, but have never gotten around to learning and using. I'm taking some time now to delve into it, after upgrading my system to version 24.4 of emacs, and using the [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit][emacs starter kit]] to initialize my emacs introduced me to =settings.org= in the =.emacs.d/<user>= directory for doing local initialization (that used to get handled with =~/.emacs=).

Within the =settings.org= file, snippets of /ELisp/ code are written, then extracted into =settings.el= to execute at startup. I found it the most delicious of programming experiences, intermingling a nice outline and documentation with executable code.

Delving further, I've discovered [[http://sachachua.org][Sacha Chua]]'s blog, and the [[http://www.orgmode.org][Org mode]] website, and all sorts of information on using =org-mode= in /so/ many areas.

** Today's Explorations

*** Capture mode

Capture mode is part of =org-mode= that lets you specify templates for things to capture, a bit different than using [yasnippets], but it's really useful for capturing todo items, links, snippets of text, and so on. It's inordinately powerful, and I've barely scraped the surface.

With capture templates, you have a whole range of options and things you capture along with what ever you're capturing, or even just use as a trigger to log an event, which is pretty awesome. Your triggers can be used to send captured things and bits to different files, even, so I have one that records new to do items to a generic GTD inbox file, another that records links in my general notes file, and another to capture a quote into a quotes file.
