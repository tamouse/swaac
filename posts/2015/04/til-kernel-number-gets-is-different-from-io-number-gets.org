/Today I Learned/: =Kernel#gets= does more than =IO#gets= does, it is not simply a shorthand way of reading from =STDIN=.

This was from a question on =irc://freenode.net/#ruby=.

=Kernel#gets= reads more than just stdin. It uses =ARGV*= unless it's empty, in which case it uses =STDIN=.

*** From the ruby docs:

At [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Kernel.html#method-i-gets][=Kernel#gets=]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Returns (and assigns to =$_=) the next line from the list of files in =ARGV= (or =$*=), or from standard input if no files are present on the command line.
#+END_QUOTE

This will read from stdin:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ ruby gets_loop.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE

This looks for the files "these", "are", "some", and "words" and read from them sequentially:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ ruby gets_loop.rb these are some words
#+END_EXAMPLE

      # This will read from ARGF a line at a time

Let's change it to =STDIN.gets=:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    puts "just a loop. ^C to exit"

    loop do
      print "> "

      # This will read from ARGF a line at a time
      # command = gets.chomp

      # To make it read *only* from stdin when there are command line
      # arguments, you have to use STDIN explicitly:
      command = STDIN.gets.chomp

      puts "Command: >>#{command.inspect}<<"
    end
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

    $ ruby gets_loop.rb
    just a loop. ^C to exit
    > hello, world
    Command: >>"hello, world"<<
    > ^Cgets_loop.rb:27:in `gets': Interrupt
        from gets_loop.rb:27:in `block in <main>'
        from gets_loop.rb:19:in `loop'
        from gets_loop.rb:19:in `<main>'


    $ ruby gets_loop.rb these are some words
    just a loop. ^C to exit
    > hello again, you world you
    Command: >>"hello again, you world you"<<
    > ^Cgets_loop.rb:27:in `gets': Interrupt
        from gets_loop.rb:27:in `block in <main>'
        from gets_loop.rb:19:in `loop'
        from gets_loop.rb:19:in `<main>'
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can see it now works the same way with and without command line arguments.
