You can easily get the end of the month, or end of the year, via sending in a negative 1 to the various date and time constructors:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    # Last day of 2015
    Date.new(2015,12,-1).to_s #=> "2015-12-31"

    # Last minute of 2015
    DateTime.new(2015,-1,-1,23,-1).to_s #=> "2015-12-31T23:59:00+00:00"
#+END_SRC

/Note:/ this does not work with =Time.new=.
