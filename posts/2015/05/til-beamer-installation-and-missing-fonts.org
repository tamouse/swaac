I have recently been playing much with emac's =org-mode= and one of the neat things is creating a presentation and exporting it to [beamer], a TeX dialect made for creating presentations.

I seemed to have all the pieces installed, so I thought, so I got to the step for testing the installation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  To test your installation, copy the file =generic-ornate-15min-45min.en.tex= from the directory =beamer/solutions/generic-talks= to some place where you usually create presentations. Then run the command =pdflatex= several times on the file and check whether the resulting pdf file looks correct. If so, you are all set.
#+END_QUOTE

Well, I wasn't all set, as it turns out I was missing a few fonts. After banging around trying to fix this, I used my awesome superpowers and searched for the error that was getting shown, and it led me to stackexchange's TeX forum:

[[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/160176/usepackagescaledhelvet-fails-on-mac-with-basictex]]

Here, I learned about installing fonts. I ran the following as root:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
#+END_EXAMPLE

and then tried the test again:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ pdflatex generic-ornate-15min-45min.en
#+END_EXAMPLE

which produces a ton of output as TeX does and the result was a success!
