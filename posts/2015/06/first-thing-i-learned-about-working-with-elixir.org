* First thing I learned about working with Elixir

So, learning a new language, [[http://elixir-lang-org][Elixir]], and after installing it (a breeze, way easier than ruby), I start up the Elixir REPL, IEx, type a few bon mots and then I'm stuck trying to quit the thing.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ iex
    Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.0] [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [kernel-poll:false]

    Interactive Elixir (1.0.5) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
    iex(1)> 40+2
    42
    iex(2)> "hello"<>"world"
    "helloworld"
    iex(3)> quit
    ** (RuntimeError) undefined function: quit/0

    iex(3)> exit
    ** (RuntimeError) undefined function: exit/0

    iex(3)> # Tried several things here: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, finally read
            # about Ctrl-G and tried that, giving me the switch command:
    User switch command
     --> ?
      c [nn]            - connect to job
      i [nn]            - interrupt job
      k [nn]            - kill job
      j                 - list all jobs
      s [shell]         - start local shell
      r [node [shell]]  - start remote shell
      q                 - quit erlang
      ? | h             - this message
     --> q

    $ # and out!
#+END_SRC

Fun stuff, but it did panic me a little as the normal things I tried didn't work.

I don't quite understand why Ctrl-C wasn't working, perhaps because of the prior two errors? I haven't been able to reproduce it subsequently, so even more likely I was just fatfingering the keyboard and missing the Ctrl-C.
