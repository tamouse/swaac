Jessie Frazelle's blog article, [[https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/][Docker Containers on the Desktop]], shows something a bit different than I've seen before.

What if you ran all your fun desktop apps in a docker container?

Why would you want to do that?

Because, as Jessica puts it, using Docker in this way provides a sandbox around you applicaitons.

  I hate installing things on my host and the files getting everywhere. I wanted the ability to delete an app and know it is gone fully without some random file hanging around. This gave me that. Not only that, I can control how much CPU and Memory the app uses. Yes, the cpu/memory hungry chrome is now perfectly contained!

Jessica's collection of docker files here, [[https://github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles][jfrazelledockerfiles]], is a super gallery of things you can do with docker, that you may not have thought of.
