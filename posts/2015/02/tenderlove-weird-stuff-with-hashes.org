A great post from @tenderlove on some interesting performance aspects of using strings for keys in hashes:

[[http://tenderlovemaking.com/2015/02/11/weird-stuff-with-hashes.html][Weird stuff with hashes]]

tl;dr:

- Hashes dup string keys and then freeze them
- Creating a lot of hashes with string keys can become a big performance hit
- Freeze the string key so Hash won't dup it and reduce object allocations and hence calls to the GC
