A nice little tutorial on creating a handler to deliver a CSV (Comma-Separated Value) file as an output view: [[http://tutor.lugolabs.com/articles/18-handling-csv-views-in-ruby-on-rails?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email][Handling CSV views in Ruby on Rails]]

What I did not see, and will have to investigate, is how the Content-Type header is set for delivery.
