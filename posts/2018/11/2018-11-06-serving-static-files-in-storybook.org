  I wish I'd known about this before taking all that time to munge the test data the first time. It turns out storybook can serve up static assets by providing the ~-s~ option on the command line:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    start-storybook -p 9009 -s ./path/to/static/assets -c .storybook/config.js
  #+END_SRC

  You can have more than one folder as well, separating them by commas

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    start-storybook -p 9009 -s ./some/assets,./other/assets,./these/assets/over/here -c .storybook/config.js
  #+END_SRC

  This makes them available at the root URL

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    http://localhost:9009/
  #+END_SRC

  So if you have assets at ~./src/components/AttachmentList/__TEST_DATA__/attachments/~, for example, ~shasta/32/original/002.jpg~, then the URL would be:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    http://localhost:9009/shasta/32/original/002.jpg
  #+END_SRC

  And even more importantly, they can be referred to relatively even without the scheme and host.
