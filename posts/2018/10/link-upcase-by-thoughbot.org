Thoughbot, a leading software engineering company, has started a new online school, their words:

> We're not a bootcamp, we're a finishing school. Become an experienced developer and take "junior" out of your title.

When you're looking for the "what's next" after completing your bootcamp experience, or when you're a mid-level practitioner looking to level up, they look like a good place to try.

Some of their features include:

- Trails - learning paths
- Videos
- Flash cards
- Forums
