Over at the [[https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap][react-bootstrap repo]], there is a pull request to deprecate the ~dismissAfter~ prop on ~Alert~ components, and in [[https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/pull/1636#issuecomment-429085552][this issue]] the author discusses a workaround if user's still need the capability.

I think generalizing that concept would be a pretty cool thing, and possibly a bit simplification for, say, the debouncer I wrote for work.
