I was helping a friend tonight with a problem they were having getting a tiny web app to run on heroku.

I spent quite some time trying to figure out the issue.

It turns out that =Heroku= reserves the =vendor/= folder for it's own use, so you can't delivery files from it. (This is true for PHP applications, at least. We didn't investigate further).

So, simple rule, don't use the =vendor/= directory in your own app.
