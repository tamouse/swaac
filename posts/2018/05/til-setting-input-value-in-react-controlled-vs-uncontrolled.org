Setting the input value on a React input element ultimately determines whether it's a controlled or uncontrolled element.

There's isn't much guidance on this, but this is what I've learned:

- to make an input value /controlled/, set the value to a string. To initialize it with "No Value" set it to the empty string: =""=.

- leaving the input value =undefined= makes the element /uncontrolled/.

- if the input value is =null=, then React complains that it can't tell whether it should be controlled or not, and tells you to set it to =undefined=.

*Beware* when you input values come from someplace else.

Note that this works fine when Rails is your backend, usually.
