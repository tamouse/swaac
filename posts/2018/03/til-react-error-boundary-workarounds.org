Recently I was working on a next-gen standalone react client for my work, and I decided I wanted to put in error boundaries, which were introduced in React v16. From the [[https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html][docs]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
#+END_QUOTE

This is well and good, but the first thing I ran into was how to catch errors that happen outside of the space React's error boundaries work in. The following aren't caught by =componentDidCatch=:

- Event handlers
- Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
- Server side rendering
- Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

The particular problem I was working on was catching login errors, which were returned as a promise rejection. Since the error boundary didn't handle this, i searched for help on this, and got it in the React.MN slack.

After thinking about it, it does make sense, since React is declarative, this pretty much has to be handled as some form of state. The key is, what to do?

I took a page out of some previous work where I was doing a =<Redirect/>= when a state entry became =true= , so I did it again for this. I'd catch the rejected promise in the handler, and set a state variable to =true=:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
    login = () => {
      logon()
        .then(
          // do logon stuff when it works
        )
        .catch(error => {
          this.setState({
            hasError: true,
            error
          })
        })
    }
#+END_SRC

So now there's a state variable =hasError= that's true, and the actual error in state. Down in the =render= method:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
    render() {
      if (this.state.hasError) throw this.state.error

      // go on with no error
    }
#+END_SRC

This does the bubble-up necessary for the error boundary to catch it.

Here's a codepen:

  </p>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
#+END_HTML

It turns out I didn't use this to handle login errors, but it was a useful excursion and learning experience anyway.
