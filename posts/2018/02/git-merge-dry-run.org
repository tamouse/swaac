There's no specific thing called a "dry run merge" with git, but it's simple enough to simulate.

In the sample below, =BRANCH= is being merged *into* =TARGET=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git checkout $TARGET
    git merge --no-commit --no-ff $BRANCH
    git diff --cached
    git merge --abort
#+END_SRC

You can look for any potential merge conflicts after the first command as well and see what you might be up against.

Note you need /both/ the =--no-commit= /AND/ =--no-ff= flags to prevent the merge from occurring if it's possible for a fast-forward merge to occur (likely).
