  As some of you following know, I've led this thing on Tuesday nights called "Toast & Tech" for about 3 years [starting in the Autumn of 2015], nominally under the organization at .@GDImpls, the Minneapolis chapter of .@girldevelopit.

  I have left that organization, but I want to leave behind something for those involved in T&T, and for those looking to make a space for learning that it inclusive

** The Tenets of Toast and Tech:

   - make *everyone* welcome, enthusiastically
   - make *all* questions welcome, enthusiastically
   - everyone is learning, everyone is teaching
   - there is no single path, there are as many paths as people attending, as many paths as needed
   - you don't need a project or tech work to attend, just come
   - you don't need any experience to attend, just come
   - support everyone who shows up
   - Make it safe to learn, safe to ask questions, safe to show up.

   Possibly the *most* important tenet of all: #ToastAndTech can happen *anywhere*, run by *anyone*; all it takes is letting folks know about it, and showing up to hold the space.
