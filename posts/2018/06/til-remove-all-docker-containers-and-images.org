I needed to do a reset on my work machine of the Docker stuff I was using, so needed to know how to do this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
    $ docker rmi $(docker images -q)
#+END_SRC

=docker ps -aq= gives a list of all the container hashes, which is given the =docker rm= command.

Similarly, =docker images -q= lists all the docker image hashes, which is given to docker's "remove images" =rmi= command.
