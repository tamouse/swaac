I just heard that Dennis Ritchie passed away: [[https://plus.google.com/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie][Dennis Ritchie]] was co-inventor of the C Programming Language, which all modern computer operating systems are based upon, with Brian Kernighan, and co-inventor of Unix, with Ken Thompson.

Ritchie, Thompson and Kernighan were all big heroes and inspirations for me in my early career. Their influence is great; many, many people will not ever know how much influence these people have had on their daily lives.

RIP, Dennis. :'(
