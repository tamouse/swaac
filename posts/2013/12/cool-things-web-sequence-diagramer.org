I was reading up on [[https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki][Gollum]], the wiki used by [[http://github.com][Github]] when I ran across this cool web tool:

A very awesome online tool that lets you create, as if it wasn't obvious, sequence diagrams online by writing text lines that indicate the elements of the sequence.

The following textual description:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    title Authentication Sequence

    Alice->Bob: Authentication Request
    note right of Bob: Bob thinks about it
    Bob->Alice: Authentication Response
#+END_EXAMPLE

creates the following diagram:

As you type into the text area, it automatically changes the diagram. One of the really cool things is that you can have the diagram formatted in a number of ways. I personally love the napkin format shown above.
