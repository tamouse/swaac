[[https://github.com/vhf][Victor Felder]] has taken his list of [[https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md][Free Programming Books]] and put it on Github for collaborative updating. (Seems it is going into other languages quite a bit.) This is a great resource for folks looking to learn something technical.
