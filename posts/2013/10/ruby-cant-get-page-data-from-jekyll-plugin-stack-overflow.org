  * Can't get page data from Jekyll plugin
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: cant-get-page-data-from-jekyll-plugin
    :END:

  I'm trying to write a custom tag plugin for Jekyll that will output a hierarchical navigation tree of all the pages (not posts) on the site. I'm basically wanting a bunch nested =<ul>='s with links (with the page title as the link text) to the pages with the current page noted by a certain CSS class.

  I'm very inexperienced with ruby. I'm a PHP guy.

  I figured I'd start just by trying to iterate through all the pages and output a one-dimensional list just to make sure I could at least do that. Here's what I have so far:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      module Jekyll

        class NavTree < Liquid::Tag
          def initialize(tag_name, text, tokens)
            super
          end

          def render(context)
            site = context.registers[:site]
            output = '<ul>'
            site.pages.each do |page|
              output += '<li><a href="'+page.url+'">'+page.title+'</a></li>'
            end
            output += '<ul>'

            output
          end
        end

      end

      Liquid::Template.register_tag('nav_tree', Jekyll::NavTree)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  And I'm inserting it into my liquid template via ={\% nav_tree %\}=.

  The problem is that the =page= variable in the code above doesn't have all the data that you'd expect. =page.title= is undefined and =page.url= is just the basename with a forward slash in front of it (e.g.Â for =/a/b/c.html=, it's just giving me =/c.html=).

  What am I doing wrong?

  *Side note:* I already tried doing this with pure Liquid markup, and I eventually gave up. I can easily iterate through =site.pages= just fine with Liquid, but I couldn't figure out a way to appropriately nest the lists.

  Did you ever manage to get the nesting working? I'd love to see the final code if so -- [[/users/401096/brand][Brand]] Aug 21 '12 at 19:35

  @Brand Unfortunately, I never got around to finishing it. -- [[/users/451201/jnrbsn][jnrbsn]] Aug 23 '12 at 23:19

  I managed to hack the hierachical page tree together. It's not pretty but I've posted it here: [[https://gist.github.com/3536551][gist.github.com/3536551]] in case anyone else stumbles on this question -- [[/users/401096/brand][Brand]] Aug 30 '12 at 18:24

  Try:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      module Jekyll

        # Add accessor for directory
        class Page
                attr_reader :dir
        end


        class NavTree < Liquid::Tag
          def initialize(tag_name, text, tokens)
            super
          end

          def render(context)
            site = context.registers[:site]
            output = '<ul>'
            site.pages.each do |page|
              output += '<li><a href="'+page.dir+page.url+'">'+(page.data['title'] || page.url) +'</a></li>'
            end
              output += '<ul>'

            output
          end
        end

      end

      Liquid::Template.register_tag('nav_tree', Jekyll::NavTree)

  With this code, I get =Liquid error: can't convert nil into String=. -- [[/users/451201/jnrbsn][jnrbsn]] May 30 '12 at 18:11

  You probably had a page without a title, so that page.data['title'] is nil. Replace w/ e.g. (page.data['title'] || page.url) . -- [[/users/1425619/mikael-borg][Mikael Borg]] Jun 4 '12 at 9:37

  Sorry for the delayed response. You were correct. I had a page without a title. Your solution works. -- [[/users/451201/jnrbsn][jnrbsn]] Jun 15 '12 at 4:32

  =page.title= is not always defined (example: =atom.xml=). You have to check if it is defined. Then you can take =page.name= or not process the entry...

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      def render(context)
        site = context.registers[:site]
        output = '<ul>'
        site.pages.each do |page|
          unless page.data['title'].nil?
            t = page.data['title']
          else
            t = page.name
          end
          output += "<li><a href="'+page.dir+page.url+'">'+t+'</a></li>"
        end
        output += '<ul>'
        output
      end
  #+END_EXAMPLE
