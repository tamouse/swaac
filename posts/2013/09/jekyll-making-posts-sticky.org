A recent visitor to the IRC channel #octopress was wondering how they could have both regular pagination and sticky posts that always show up on the first page.

*Update:* The solution proposed here is pretty old and not that great. Have a look at [[file:%7B%%20link%20_posts/2017-09-04-jekyll-making-posts-sticky-redux.markdown%20%%7D][Jekyll: Making Posts Sticky Redux]] for a better way to do it (or two better ways!)

Seemingly simple, the proffered solutions did not seem to fit the bill. This is the way I've solved this.

** Proposed solutions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: proposed-solutions
   :END:

 The ideas proposed included doing something to keep the post far in the future, thus sorting out first always in the paginator. This seemed a bit too hacky.

 Another offered adding a sticky page variable in the front matter. This has a lot of promise, and could work, but gathering up the posts which are sticky would probably require writing a plugin.

 Yet another was to add a sticky category to the post in the front matter. This can work as well, and has the advantage of not needing a new plugin.

** Using a sticky category
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: using-a-sticky-category
   :END:

 This seems simplest and most accessible, although requiring more alteration of the =index.html= file in the =source= directory.

 The implementation is shown in the following gist:

 #+BEGIN_HTML
   <script src="https://gist.github.com/tamouse/a160be1cb467f611c9ba.js"></script>
 #+END_HTML

 The post itself gets a =sticky= category and the =index.html= file is changed to display sticky posts on the first page.
