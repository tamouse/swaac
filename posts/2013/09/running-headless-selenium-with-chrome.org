* Running Headless Selenium with Chrome

  Scaling website automation for either testing or scraping can be a challenge when the site is enitrely driven by JavaScript or behaves differently when using specific browsers.

  Running a headless Selenium machine with Google's Chrome installed provides a scalable way to automate your tests on one of the most popular browsers in use.

  Here are step by step instructions for installing a headless Selenium server with Chrome and Vagrant.

** Spike Goals

  - Get up and running quickly
  - Run a sample script that demos it works
  - Use JavaScript only (via NodeJS)

** Prerequisites

  The code you write locally should work when deployed at scale in production. These tools help us do that by creating identical environments for development and production.

  /Both are free downloads. Install with the default settings/

  - Download and install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]]
  - Download and install [[http://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]]
  - Download and install [[http://nodejs.org/download/][NodeJS]]

  /I also assume you can use a command line and have some vague idea of what a virtual machine and Vagrant is./

** Create a "Vagrantfile"

  This file tells Vagrant how configure the testing environment. It applies universally to both development and production.

  Create a project directory and create a file named =Vagrantfile=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      # encoding: utf-8
      # -*- mode: ruby -*-
      # vi: set ft=ruby :

      Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "precise64"
        config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"
        config.ssh.forward_agent = true

        config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|
          aws.access_key_id = 'XXXX'      # Replace this
          aws.secret_access_key = 'XXXX'  # Replace this
          aws.keypair_name = 'XXXX'       # Replace this
          aws.ami = 'ami-7747d01e'        # ubuntu 12.04
          override.ssh.username = 'ubuntu'
          override.ssh.private_key_path = '~/.ssh/amazon-ubuntu.pem'
        end

        config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "setup.sh"
        config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest:4444, host:4444

      end
  #+END_SRC

** 2. Create "setup.sh"

  The setup.sh file executes when Vagrant creates a virtual machine for you. In the same folder as you created your =VagrantFile= create a =setup.sh= file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      #!/bin/sh
      set -e

      if [ -e /.installed ]; then
        echo 'Already installed.'

      else
        echo ''
        echo 'INSTALLING'
        echo '----------'

        # Add Google public key to apt
        wget -q -O - "https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub" | sudo apt-key add -

        # Add Google to the apt-get source list
        echo 'deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list

        # Update app-get
        apt-get update

        # Install Java, Chrome, Xvfb, and unzip
        apt-get -y install openjdk-7-jre google-chrome-stable xvfb unzip

        # Download and copy the ChromeDriver to /usr/local/bin
        cd /tmp
        wget "https://chromedriver.googlecode.com/files/chromedriver_linux64_2.2.zip"
        wget "https://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar"
        unzip chromedriver_linux64_2.2.zip
        mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin
        mv selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar /usr/local/bin

        # So that running `vagrant provision` doesn't redownload everything
        touch /.installed
      fi

      # Start Xvfb, Chrome, and Selenium in the background
      export DISPLAY=:10
      cd /vagrant

      echo "Starting Xvfb ..."
      Xvfb :10 -screen 0 1366x768x24 -ac &

      echo "Starting Google Chrome ..."
      google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 &

      echo "Starting Selenium ..."
      cd /usr/local/bin
      nohup java -jar ./selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar &
  #+END_SRC

** 3. Run "vagrant up"

  On your command line and in the directory where you created the =VagrantFile=, run the following command:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      vagrant up
  #+END_SRC

  This will kick off downloading and installing all the pieces neccessary. It should look like this:

** 4. Make sure it's running

  You can check to see if everything is working by going to =http://localhost:4444/wd/hub=.

  The =VagrantFile= has been configured to forward port 4444 on your localhost. This allows you UI control of the Selenium browser. This page shows you all the sessions that you're running in your virtual machine. If you see this page, everything is OK.

** 5. Install the selenium-webdriver

  In order to write NodeJS scripts that talk to Chrome you will need the Selenium-Webdriver for NodeJS.

  On your command line, install =selenium-webdriver= with the following command. This will install the modules needed for interacting with Selenium.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    npm install selenium-webdriver
  #+END_SRC

** 6. Write your first Selenium script

  This first script will go to Google's homepage, type in a query, then print out the HTML.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');

    var keyword = "chris le twitter";

    var driver = new webdriver.Builder().
       usingServer('http://localhost:4444/wd/hub').
       withCapabilities(webdriver.Capabilities.chrome()).
       build();

    driver.get('http://www.google.com');
    driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('q')).sendKeys(keyword);
    driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('btnG')).click();
    driver.wait(function() {
      return driver.getTitle().then(function(title) {
	driver.getPageSource().then(function(html) {
	  console.log(html);
	  return true;
	});
      });
    }, 1000);

    driver.quit();
  #+END_SRC

** 7. Run your test

  Run your test with node. You should see the HTML that was rendered by the Chrome browser.

* Use Cases

  So now that you have this up and running what can you use it for?

  *Running your automated test suites*: This is great for doing integration testing against Chrome browsers and probably responsive websites.

  *Testing your Chrome Extentions*: Debugging Chrome Extensions can be a bit of a pain. This could be your Asprin.

  *Taking many screenshots*: If you want to make screenshots of many pages at once.

  *Scraping stubborn websites*: I wasn't able to scrape a website using PhantomJS because it fired JSONP requests long after the onLoad() event fired. Simply waiting for the event loop to empty itself wansn't enough. A combination of debugging with a real browser and Selenium, I was more successful at getting the DOM after the scripts had run.
