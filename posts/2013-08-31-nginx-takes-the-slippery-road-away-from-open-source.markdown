> [open source Nginx Web server](http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-servers/nginx-overtakes-microsoft-no-2-web-server-183079) [1] took a turn to the proprietary this week and [announced a paid-only edition called Nginx plus](http://news.techworld.com/applications/3465208/nginx-web-server-goes-commercial-with-new-release/)

> The company had previously relied for revenue on large-scale and

> Of course, others couldn't understand that reaction; one voice

> "Nginx offers premium support to companies it is making millions for,
> gets hit w/ fountain of nerdrage because they're somehow less free now."
> But the switch to open core definitely diminishes the commercial value
> of open source software; "freedom" is not just conceptual. By
> withholding the flexibility to use for any purpose, study the source,
> adapt the software, and pass to anyone without permission, Nginx has
> paradoxically lowered its value.
> 
> **Why open core is worth less**
> Consider the general case. When any business uses this model, they have
> an open source "community edition" of their software product, which
> lacks many features of the commercial versions. It is indeed freely
> available under an open source license and fully functional. There will
> be many happy deployers of this version. If this was the only version
> available, there would be no issues.
> 
> The proprietary versions are significantly different from the community
> version, perhaps with both the user interface and the functions. While
> paid licensees are often entitled to source access to this version, the
> proprietary licence is not perpetual -- if the customer ends their
> relationship with the vendor, they lose the right to use this version.
> 
> Since this version significantly differs from the community version,
> there is no fallback plan, and while the customer may have access to
> their data (if the vendor is sufficiently enlightened about open data),
> there's no software they can continue to use. They are unable to trade
> time for money, to use Mårten Mickos’ famous explanation -- they are
> locked in, and the open source core of the proprietary version delivers
> no freedom to them.
> 
> If this latter situation was described as "proprietary" (or avoided
> association with open source, as for example IBM's WebSphere does in its
> embedding of Apache HTTPD) there would be no practical issues either. If
> it's clear you're surrendering your flexibility in return for
> convenience, that's your choice.
> 
> The fact is, the community edition and the commercial editions have
> disjointed user bases. The community edition is used by a group of
> people who have the time and skills to deploy by themselves and who have
> no need of the many differences of the commercial versions. The
> commercial versions are feature-rich and effectively lock their users
> into a traditional commercial ISV relationship with the vendor. If these
> two were kept distinct, there would probably be no pragmatic issue.
> (Naturally, free-software advocates would still protest the existence of
> closed code, but that's not a part of this particular argument.)
> 
> But a vendor that mixes these two encourages exactly the market
> confusion that OSI was designed to minimize. If they claim to be an open
> source business and use the presence of the community edition as a
> credential to sell the proprietary versions, they wrap themselves in the
> open source flag and their actions are exactly the gaming of the
> maturity of open source that I believe should be challenged.
> 
> Will Nginx try to wrap itself in the reputation of its previous good
> open source citizenry while encouraging its customers to do without the
> flexibility of open source? Time will tell, but I strongly encourage the
> company to avoid this trap.
