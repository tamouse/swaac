Beware the *F*lash *O*f *U*nstyled *T*ext! That moment of flicker on
your page before your webfonts have downloaded and the screen is
showoing your fallback font.

[Monica Dinculescu](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) has written a nice
tool that *shows* how your lovely chosen webfont will FOUT (yeah, I
just verbed that acronym) against your backup font, but more
interestingly, *what you can do about it*.

Here's a screenshot comparing Impact and Montserrat:

It's a really great tool!
