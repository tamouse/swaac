I just moderated the [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com)
class "Complete Introduction to React" taught
by [Brian Holt](https://twitter.com/holtbt) of Netflix and Reddit
fame.

It was a great course, but as moderator I was doing a lot of things to
keep the chat room flowing and didn't get to pay much attention to the
detail Brian was presenting, and definitely didn't have time in class
to try out stuff.

So I thought I'd just give the first bit of Brian's presentation a go,
where we just worked with React as a plain JS library, nothing fancy,
no JSX transpiling, etc.

[This]({{page.source}}) is the result, the canonical single page Todo
application.

It was pretty easy, and pretty fun. I kept only to
the [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/), especially

* [React Without ES6 - React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-without-es6.html)
* [React Without JSX - React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-without-jsx.html)

I'm pleased with the experiement.
