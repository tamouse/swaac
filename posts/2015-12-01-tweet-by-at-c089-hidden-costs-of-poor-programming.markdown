wow is this ever true:

Back in the day, at the *old* HP (not this one, the one that still was
named after the founders, Bill and Dave), we talked quite a bit about
"Cost of Quality" -- which was entirely directed at the costs of
*poor* quality code released into the field. The direct costs went up
by one or two orders of magnitude each step along the lifecycle. The
cost of fixing a bug post-release were something like 10 thousand
times the cost of fixing it in development.
