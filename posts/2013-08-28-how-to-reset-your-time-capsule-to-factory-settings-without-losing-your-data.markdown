## Summary

> But you will first have to try and restart your Time Capsule, this solves in many cases most of the problems, you can restart your Time Capsule by using the AirPort configuration application. When this doesn’t solve the problems, you will have to reset the Time Capsule to the default factory settings by performing a hard reset.

> When performing a hard reset, Time Capsule will lose all the settings including authorization access and radius data. The backup data of your system and the name of your Time Capsule will however be safe on your Time Capsule.
