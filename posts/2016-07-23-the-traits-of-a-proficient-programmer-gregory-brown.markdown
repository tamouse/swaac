This article touches on something close to my heart: helping students
get beyond the gap between just knowing a bunch of things and
acquiring the "mind of the developer" (borrowing a phrase from an
anthropologist friend) -- the point at which the person shifts from just
collecting knowledge, skills, and facts to having the mind-set of how
best to apply them, when not to apply them, know which ones apply, and
so on. In another analogy, the jazz musician who knows when to lay
out, when to not play the note, how to phrase, and produce jazz, not
just strings of notes.

Not everyone gets there, but I think most who try can eventually get
there. I'm still not sure what part we educators play in this, other
than give encouragement and provide a rich environment for learning.

Proficiency is learned, I feel, in the doing of something, with the
guidance for introspection and reflection.
