I figured this out once, but lost it somewhere, so I'm recording here
for sure: How to make a web page attain it's full height, with a page
header, page footer, and a main content section, so the footer will be
on the bottom if the main content section is not tall enough.

This was based off
a [{{ page.css-tricks.title }}]({{ page.css-tricks.href }})
article
[{{ page.source_title }}]({{ page.source }})

Trying some a bit new, am using an embedded gist:
